# Chapter 7. Summary and critique of Amit Goswami’s interpretation of quantum theory within monistic idealism

[[toc]]

## 7.1. The physics of monistic idealism

Until now, except for the subjective interpretation of quantum theory, the physics that has been discussed is based on the concept of an external, objective reality verified by experimental observations and, as long as the alternative interpretations of quantum theory that were presented are included, it would probably receive consensus agreement among most physicists. However, the present chapter is much more speculative. In it we present some of the results from Amit Goswami’s 1993 book, *The Self-Aware Universe*. We shall see that Goswami assumes the validity of the concept of an objective reality, but is forced into a questionable extension of this concept into a realm that is unmeasurable and unverifiable, the transcendental realm. We cite Goswami’s theory as a good example of the quandary that results when an *objective theory* is postulated to explain *subjective experience*.

Goswami attempts to place his quantum theory of consciousness within the overall context of monistic idealism (see [Section 1.4](/chapter-1-three-major-metaphysical-philosophies#_1-4-idealism-pure-subjectivity-the-philosophy-that-consciousness-is-all-and-all-is-consciousness)). In so doing, he postulates that consciousness has the following structure:

<div class="loweralphalist">

1. Consciousness, the ground of all being, is primary.
2. Consciousness contains the following three realms: the two immanent realms, which are the world of matter and the world of mental phenomena; and the transcendental realm. All of these realms exist within and as consciousness, so there is nothing outside of consciousness.
3. The transcendental realm is the source of the immanent realms. In his theory, the immanent realms are the phenomenal manifestation of the transcendental realm.

Traditional idealism holds that consciousness is the primary reality, and that all objects, whether material or mental, are objects within consciousness. However, it does not explain how the individual subject or experiencer in the subject–object experience arises. Even traditional monistic idealism, however, states that the consciousness of the individual subject is *identical* to the consciousness that is the ground of all being. The sense of separation that we feel is an illusion, as has always been claimed by the sages.

The sages proclaim that separation does not exist in reality. Ignorance of our true nature gives us the illusion of separateness, and this sense of separateness is the basis of all of our suffering (see [Chapter 11](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/)). Monistic idealism tells us that the sense of separation is illusory, but Goswami’s interpretation of quantum theory within monistic idealism goes further by purporting to explain how the illusion arises.

As we saw in [Section 6.9](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean#_6-9-the-astonishing-implications-of-the-non-locality-of-consciousness), if wave-function collapse is the mechanism for manifestation, it must be simultaneous everywhere. Yet, in an objective theory, how can it manifest everywhere simultaneously without violating Einsteinian locality? Goswami replies that, in monistic idealism, wave-function collapse does not occur in space–time because wave-function collapse is what manifests space–time. He argues that the wave-function exists not in space–time, but in a transcendental domain. Therefore, wave-function collapse does not violate Einsteinian locality.

The transcendental realm must not be thought of as including, or as being included in, the physical world of space–time. Transcendental in this context means absence of space–time. The transcendental realm cannot be located or perceived. It can be pointed to but only by pointing away from all that is perceived — not this, not that, not anything known, not anything knowable.

Recall that, in our adaptation of Plato’s cave allegory (see [Section 1.4](/chapter-1-three-major-metaphysical-philosophies#_1-4-idealism-pure-subjectivity-the-philosophy-that-consciousness-is-all-and-all-is-consciousness)), the material world consists of the shadows of Plato’s transcendental archetypes. In Goswami’s picture, the wave-functions are the equivalent of the transcendental archetypes. Consciousness manifests the immanent from the transcendent by collapsing the wave-function. All of this occurs entirely within consciousness.

## 7.2. Schrödinger’s cat revisited

We recall that the cat paradox ([Section 4.2](/chapter-4-waves-interference#_4-2-schrodinger%E2%80%99s-cat-paradox)) was invented by Schrödinger to point out the strange consequences of coupling the microscopic with the macroscopic in such a way that both must be included in the wave-function. Let us review this paradox.

A radioactive atom, a Geiger counter, a vial of poison gas and a cat are in a box. The atom has a 50% chance of decaying in one minute. If it decays, the Geiger counter is triggered, causing the poison to be released and the cat to die. If it does not decay, the cat is still alive after one minute. At one minute, I look to see if the cat is alive or dead. We assume that everything in the box can be described by quantum theory, so before I look there is nothing but a wave-function. The wave-function contains a superposition of two terms, one describing a dead cat and one describing a live cat. Before I look, there is neither a dead nor a live cat. When I look, I do not see a superposition, I see either a dead or a live cat. The dead cat part of the wave-function represents, with increasing probability, a cat that may have been dead for any time up to one minute.

The idealist interpretation of Goswami states that, before observation, the cat is in a superposition of live and dead states and this superposition is collapsed by our observation. This is similar to the Copenhagen interpretation, except that in Goswami’s version, the superposition of states is in the transcendental realm, while in the Copenhagen case, the superposition is in physical space–time. Any conscious observer including the cat itself, or even a cockroach in the box, may collapse the wave-function. Different observations, whether by the same or by different observers, will in general have different results, but only within the limits allowed by quantum theory and the probabilities given by it.^[Technical note: This discussion ignores the effects of decoherence processes that occur before an observation (see [Section 6.7](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean#_6-7-the-many-worlds-interpretation-a-partly-objective-and-partly-subjective-interpretation)). Decoherence theory is a many-worlds theory that, for our purposes, can be considered equivalent to the Copenhagen interpretation (see [Section 6.8](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean#_6-8-the-similarity-between-the-copenhagen-and-many-worlds-interpretations)).]

Suppose two observers simultaneously look in a box in which the wave-function still has not collapsed. Which observer collapses the wave-function? It is the same paradox as that of two detectors and two observers in the Stern–Gerlach experiment described in [Section 6.5](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean#_6-5-wave-function-reduction-in-the-copenhagen-interpretation-the-forward-direction-of-time). The only resolution is that the consciousness that collapses the wave-function must be unitary and non-local (universal). This means that what appears to be individual consciousness is in reality universal consciousness. In other words, the consciousness that I think is mine is identical to the consciousness that you think is yours. This does not mean that the contents of my mind are the same as the contents of your mind. These are individual, and depend on our individual sensory mechanisms, brain structures and conditioning.

In quantum theory, observation is not a continuous process, but is a rapid sequence of discrete snapshot-like observations. ‘Between’ successive observations, there is only the wave-function, in most cases a very complex one. This wave-function includes not only the external world, but also our body–minds. Change occurs only ‘between’ observations, but remember that according to Goswami, the wave-function ‘between’ observations exists in the transcendental realm outside of time, so change actually occurs discontinuously in time. Only the wave-function can change and it changes in accordance with quantum theory. (For example, human vision cannot discern more than about twenty different images per second, which corresponds to about fifty milliseconds per image. Movies are filmed at twenty four or thirty frames per second so that motion appears to be continuous instead of flickering. In classical Indian philosophy, the duration of one discrete observation is called a *kshana*, which is stated to be 1/4500 minute or 1/75 second.^[[Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary](http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/ke-kz.htm)])

:::tip Exercise
Find a quiet place and close your eyes. Focus on your body sensations, particularly those in your hands or feet. See if you feel a tingling sensation in them. Do you think this is evidence that sensations are discrete rather than continuous? Now, with your eyes still closed, focus on your visual field. Do you see the tiny grainy fluctuations? Do you think these are evidence that sensations are discrete rather than continuous?

:::tip Question
When you see a slow motion scene in a movie, why does it seem to be continuous rather than flickering?
:::

At the present time, most mainstream physicists think quantum theory can describe any physical object, including cats and our own bodies. In cosmology, even the entire early universe is thought to have been represented by a wave-function. This is an enormous extrapolation from the most complex, but still relatively simple, objects that have been experimentally shown to obey quantum theory (see [Section 4.2](/chapter-4-waves-interference#_4-2-schrodinger%E2%80%99s-cat-paradox)). Nevertheless, in this chapter we shall make the assumption that everything in the physical world is quantum mechanical. However, we must keep in mind that this assumption ignores the difficulties in interpreting quantum theory and in resolving its paradoxes, as discussed in [Chapter 6](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean/).

## 7.3. The world in idealism

We now face the problem of understanding how the ‘external’ world arises. If the universe is a wave-function in the transcendental domain ‘until’ the first conscious observation, and the transcendental domain is outside of space–time, then time itself does not exist until observations begin. Space–time, the observed universe and the brain-sensory system are all manifested simultaneously. This does not occur ‘until’ the wave-function for a sufficiently complex brain–sensory system is present so that an aware, sentient being can be manifested simultaneously with the observation. Actually, this process is occurring constantly: space–time, observing objects and observed objects are constantly and simultaneously being materialised by collapse of the wave-function, see [Figure 1](#figure1).

:::tip Question
What is the evidence for the constant and simultaneous creation of space–time, observing objects, and observed objects? What is the evidence against it?
:::

Non-local consciousness collapses the wave-function. Space–time, perceived objects and perceiving objects simultaneously appear. The external, perceived objects, many of which are also perceiving objects, form the external, objective, empirical reality. These objects are macroscopic and classical; therefore they have essentially no uncertainties in position and velocity. They appear to be stable because, while their wave-functions change ‘between’ observations, in perceived time this happens slowly. Perceiving objects derive their self-consciousness and awareness from the non-local, universal consciousness that materialises them. We will see later how this happens.

## 7.4. The quantum–classical brain

None of the traditional idealist philosophies explains how the personal ‘I’ experience arises. This is such a persistent and compelling experience that it must be explained.

Goswami proposes a model of the brain-mind that has a *quantum part* and a *classical part* that are coupled together. In justifying the quantum part of the brain–mind, Goswami notes that the mind has several properties that are quantum-like:

<div class=loweralphalist>

1. Uncertainty and complementarity. A thought has *feature*, which is instantaneous content, analogous to the position of a particle. It also has *association*, which is movement, analogous to the velocity (or momentum) of a particle. A thought occurs in the field of awareness, which is analogous to space. Feature and association are complementary. If we concentrate on one and clearly identify it (small uncertainty), we tend to lose sight of the other (large uncertainty).
2. Discontinuity, or jumps. For example, in creative thinking, new concepts appear discontinuously.
3. Non-locality. The correlations in the observations of different observers is a form of non-locality (see <a href=/chapter-4-waves-interference#_4-3-bell%E2%80%99s-theorem-the-aspect%E2%80%93groblacher-experiments-and-the-non-locality-of-reality>Section 4.3</a>).
4. Superposition. Psychological experiments by A.J. Marcel,^[*Conscious and preconscious recognition of polysemous words: locating the selective effect of prior verbal context*, in *Attention and Performance VIII* (1980), (Ed., R.S. Nickerson)] too complicated to be discussed here, can be interpreted in terms of a model of the subject’s brain which exists in a superposition of possibilities until the subject recognises the object.
