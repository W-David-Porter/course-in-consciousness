# Chapter 20. Understanding by Direct Seeing

[[toc]]

## 20.1. The role of concepts in *Advaita*

Understanding starts with a concept, such as the concept that the manifestation is purely conceptual, and proceeds to seeing directly that no object is real.

In the meditation for January 4 in *A Net of Jewels* (1996), Ramesh says:

>The only true understanding is that nothing is, not even he who understands.

In the meditation for June 21, he says:

>Although it can be seen, the universe is nonetheless purely conceptual and has no actual substance or reality of its own. All phenomena are non-existent by nature. Other than the primal Absolute subjectivity in which all exists, nothing in fact does exist!

Objects can never be real because all objects change, and Reality never changes. However, although they are never real, concepts can be true, meaning that they can negate concepts that are untrue. Untrue concepts are those that assert and maintain the reality of objects, such as the world, the individual and the body, either explicitly or implicitly. A primary purpose of this course is to see the unreality of all objects. In this way, Reality is uncovered and becomes Self-evident.

*Advaita* teaches that Consciousness (God) is all there is (see [Section 10.1](/chapter-10-teaching-non-duality/#_10-1-the-metaphysics-of-non-duality), [Section 11.1](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-1-the-nature-of-duality), [Section 14.3](/chapter-14-religion-belief-non-duality/#_14-3-a-non-dualistic-view-of-god)). However, that is a pointer to Reality, not a description of It.

The unreality of all concepts is powerfully stated in the often-quoted words of Ramana Maharshi:

>There is neither creation nor destruction; Neither destiny nor free will; Neither path nor achievement: This is the final truth.

There is a parallel statement in the Buddhist text, *Visuddhimagga* XVI:

>Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found.  
The deeds are, but no doër of the deeds is there.  
*Nibbana* [Nirvana] is, but not the man that enters it.  
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen…^[see [Buddha, The Word (the Eightfold Path)](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/buddha2.htm)]

and further:

>No doër of the deeds is found,  
No one who ever reaps their fruits;  
Empty phenomena roll on [unfold]:  
This only is the correct view.

>And while the deeds and their results  
Roll on and on, conditioned all,  
There is no first beginning found,  
Just as it is with seed and tree…

>No god, no Brahma, can be called  
The maker of this wheel of life:  
Empty phenomena roll on,  
Dependent on conditions all.^[see [Fundamentals of Buddhism](http://www.angelfire.com/indie/anna_jones1/fundamental.html)]

Chapter III, Verse 27 of the classical Hindu text, the *Bhagavad Gita*, says:

>Actions are wrought in all cases by the energies of Nature. He whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks “I am the doër”.

On page 22 of *The Relationship Between ‘I’ and ‘me’* (2006), Ramesh paraphrases these as follows:

>Events happen, deeds get done, consequences happen, but there is no one doing any deed.

We remind the reader that, as we said in [Section 14.1](/chapter-14-religion-belief-non-duality/#_14-1-the-difference-between-religion-and-non-duality), concepts in spiritual teachings are used as pointers to Reality rather than as concepts to be believed. In practical terms, this means that the function of a concept is to facilitate disidentification. This results in a sense of freedom and peace, and in release from suffering. This is its only function. If it fails to do that, the concept is useless at best, and at worst, it strengthens identification. An analogy often used by spiritual teachers to illustrate this point is that a concept is like a finger pointing to the moon (Reality). When one sees the moon (when awakening occurs), the finger is forgotten.

However, a common mistake among spiritual seekers is to regard the concept itself as truth, and thus to cling to it. This is like worshipping the finger rather than looking at what it is pointing to. In doing so, the ego averts a threat to its existence. For example, if a religion regards its concepts as truth, it is worshipping the finger (see [Chapter 14](/chapter-14-religion-belief-non-duality/)). Another mistake is to look at a spiritual concept and to disregard what it is pointing to because of resistance to the concept itself. Again, the ego averts a threat to its existence. Most materialists and many scientists make this mistake when they refuse to question the reality of ‘objective reality’.

:::tip Question
Have you ever observed or experienced an example of worshipping the finger rather than the moon?
:::

Different spiritual teachers use different concepts, but always for the same purpose. A seeker is usually drawn to a teacher who uses a conceptual system that is acceptable to him in some way. Acceptability usually means that the concepts are consistent with the seeker’s intuition and experience. However, as a seeker matures, the concepts used by a teacher may be less and less useful for disidentification. Indeed, they can even begin to generate more suffering than they relieve because they can begin to produce more and more conflicts with the seeker’s intuition and experience. In such cases, the seeker scarcely needs to be told to find another teacher. However, this can be easier said than done if the seeker has developed a strong personal relationship with the teacher, or if the seeker is deluded by the teacher into thinking that staying with him is the only way to salvation. This kind of delusion is responsible for the many stories of seekers having clung to a teacher long after the teacher’s usefulness has faded. Probably the best attitude to take towards spiritual teachers is to use them as resources, without regarding any one of them as one’s only avenue to salvation. The spiritual marketplace is no different from the commercial marketplace in this respect, so, even here, the guiding rule is *caveat emptor*.
