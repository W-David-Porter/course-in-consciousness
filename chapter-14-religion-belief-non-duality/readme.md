# Chapter 14. Religion, Belief and Non-Duality

## 14.1. The difference between religion and non-duality

In the meditation for April 30 of *A Net of Jewels* (1996), Ramesh says:

>Religions were originally based on direct or absolute Truth. In the course of time they degenerated into concepts. And on these concepts has been erected gradually an enormous, amorphous structure enchanting enough to attract and mislead millions of people.

Because suffering is often grounded in deep-seated religious beliefs ([Section 11.8](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-8-sin-guilt-and-shame-%E2%80%94-monstrosities-of-mind)), such suffering will not end until these beliefs are deeply questioned. However, because there are no doërs (see [Section 11.4](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-4-objectification-the-second-level-of-identification)), nobody has any choice about what he believes, or about whether or not to question them. If questioning happens, it happens. If not, it doesn’t. Nevertheless, in this chapter (and for much of the course), for the purpose of ease in communication, we shall use the active (doër) mode of speaking instead of the more accurate passive (non-doër) mode.

:::tip Question
Have you suffered as a result of religious teachings?
:::

Religion can be defined as a belief system plus a power structure to enforce the belief system. The power structure can be overt, as in a conventional religion, or it can be a subtle pressure from a group to conform. Within this definition, the Western culture of individual identity and striving is a religion, politics is a religion, science is a religion, materialism is a religion, medicine is a religion, idealism is a religion and even *Advaita* can be a religion. Whenever we try to correct somebody’s belief, we are acting as the thought police to enforce a belief system. When there is no ‘we’ to do anything, a response to a belief may arise but it will never be separative because it will come from the absence of separation.

*This is a course in seeing and understanding, not in belief.* In non-duality, Reality transcends all concepts, so Reality cannot be conceptualised. Non-duality as a teaching contains many concepts, but all of them are meant to be pointers to Reality that can be verified by experience. To mistakenly believe the concepts as Reality Itself would actually prevent one from realising Reality. In the end, the only validity of any concepts is in their usefulness in bringing about awakening and the end of suffering.

:::tip Question
Why can’t belief bring you to Reality?
:::

On p. 109 of *The Wisdom of Nisargadatta* (1992) by Robert Powell, Nisargadatta says:

>By following any religion, cult or creed, one becomes inevitably conditioned, because one is obliged to conform and accept its disciplines, both physical and mental. One may get a little peace for some time, but such a peace will not last long. In your true nature, you are the knower of concepts and therefore prior to them.

On p. 65 of the same book, Nisargadatta says:

>Those who know only scriptures know nothing. To know is to be.

In the meditation for August 25 in *A Net of Jewels* (1996), Ramesh says:

>Belief, any belief, is based on the sense of insecurity. Only when all belief is given up are you free to know yourself. In self discovery what you find is the Truth — that Truth which is total, self-evident and which needs no outside support or justification.

There is an enormous difference between the teachings of non-duality and those of religion. There is no theology in non-duality, whereas theology is the basis of all religion. A theology is a dualistic belief system which contains critical concepts that one is asked to believe as Truth but which cannot be verified within the individual’s own experience. The teaching of non-duality differs from religion by heavily relying on practices (see [Chapter 22](/chapter-22-disidentification-from-attachment-aversion/), [Chapter 23](/chapter-23-disidentification-through-inquiry/), [Chapter 24](/chapter-24-disidentification-through-meditation/), [Chapter 25](/chapter-25-love-finding-itself/)) that are aimed at revealing your true nature in a way that mere concepts cannot. Without the practices, non-duality is nothing but metaphysics.

The world’s scriptures can be interpreted in many different ways. At one extreme are the fundamentalist interpretations, which assume that the words are literal truth. These interpretations are necessarily dualistic because all words taken literally are dualistic (see [Section 11.1](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-1-the-nature-of-duality)), and they always conceive of God and humans as separate beings. Examples of scriptures that are interpreted literally by fundamentalists are the Hebrew and Christian Bibles. At the other extreme are the non-dualistic interpretations, which regard the words as nothing but pointers to Reality. An example of a scripture that is most naturally interpreted non-dualistically is the *Ashtavakra Gita*.^[See, e.g., a highly regarded translation without commentary called *The Heart of Awareness* by John Richards, A translation with commentary, entitled *Duet of One* (1989), was authored by Ramesh Balsekar, see [Appendix](/appendix/).] A scripture that lends itself in some parts to a dualistic interpretation and in other parts to a non-dualistic interpretation is the [*Bhagavad Gita*](https://www.bhagavad-gita.us/).

## 14.2. Religion as the belief in a dualistic god

In the meditation for August 28 of *A Net of Jewels* (1996), Ramesh says:

>When a person finds that his own efforts are fruitless, then he turns to a power, he creates a power, conceives a power which will give him what he himself cannot get. He creates a concept, worships it, prays to it and begs it to give him what he wants. When even that entity fails to give him what he is seeking, further frustration and misery arise.

In religion, mankind creates its gods in its own images, and each religion then justifies its actions by claiming it speaks for its god. The more vengeful and punitive is the god, the more vengeful and punitive are the people who created it and who believe in it. Furthermore, if we think of God as being separate from us, we will not be able to avoid asking such questions as, “Why did God create suffering?” or, “Why is God doing this to *me*?”. Thus, many adherents to Christianity are described as being God-fearing, not God-loving. Any belief in a separate god induces guilt, expiation of which often takes the form of trying to induce guilt in others. It is no accident that the most peaceful religions are the ones, like Buddhism, that have no concept of god.

:::tip Questions
Have you ever asked the question, “Why did God create suffering?” or, “Why is God doing this to *me*?”.
:::

Religions often preach love without knowing what Love is (see [Chapter 16](/chapter-16-love-seeking-itself/) and [Chapter 25](/chapter-25-love-finding-itself/)). Many religious fundamentalists interpret their god’s love for them to be inseparable from its hatred for others. The U.S. political movement known as the [Christian religious right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right) is one such group. Its primary spokesmen are Robert Grant, Pat Robertson, John Hagee, Rod Parsley, Franklin Graham, James Dobson, and Jerry Falwell (deceased 2007).

The scientific paradigm (see [Section 2.1](/chapter-2-classical-physics-newton-einstein/#_2-1-the-scientific-method)) has produced the theory of biological evolution. Since God is unnecessary in this theory, fundamentalist Christians are attempting to impose an anti-evolutionary doctrine on the educational systems in several States in the U.S. This doctrine takes two forms, creationism and intelligent design. Both doctrines are derived from Biblical stories of a universe created by God, and as such, require a belief in a dualistic God.^[see [TalkOrigins Archive: Exploring the Creation/Evolution Controversy](http://www.talkorigins.org)]

Fundamentalists often create enemies on whom to displace their feelings of self-punishment, self-fear and self-hatred (see [Section 11.8](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-8-sin-guilt-and-shame-%E2%80%94-monstrosities-of-mind)). Their (unrecognised) self-punishment can be so unbearable that they try to compensate by believing that they are God’s favoured few, and, in the name of this god, endeavour to eliminate a competing religion by trying to convert, demonise or kill its adherents. Their fear of another religion or teaching can be even greater than their fear of death.

The belief that God has sanctioned violence leads to additional violence, not only among believers, but also among non-believers. (The daily news contains ample evidence that this is so.) Scientifically, this has been demonstrated by having a group of five hundred students read a passage depicting violence in the Old Testament. Half of the students also read another passage saying that God commanded that the evil-doërs be chastened. The half reading the additional passage were more likely to act aggressively in a later exercise, whether they were believers or not.^[*Nature* 446, 114–115 (8 March 2007)]

Following are a few examples of violent clashes between competing religious beliefs that resulted in executions, massacres and wars:

 * In less than a century after Mohammed (570–633) died, Muslims, in their missionary zeal to convert the ‘infidels’, conquered Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, Egypt, North Africa and the South of Spain. In the eighth and ninth centuries they conquered Persia, Afghanistan and a large part of India, and in the twelfth century they had already become the absolute masters of all Western Asia, Spain, North Africa and Sicily.
 * Between 1095 and 1270, with the blessing of the popes, and with the intention of protecting the Holy Land and keeping the pilgrim routes open to Jerusalem, Christians launched several crusades, mostly from France, slaughtering hundreds of thousands of Muslims.
 * In 1478, Pope Sixtus IV initiated the Spanish Inquisition in order to purify Christian communities of all Jews and Muslims, even those who had converted to Christianity. This quickly became an instrument to expand state power and to fill its treasury with the estates of those found guilty of being less than fully Christian.
 * In 1517, Martin Luther (1483–1546) in Wittenberg, Germany, repulsed by papal authority and its practice of buying and selling indulgences (the remission of religious penalties for sinning, including freeing the soul from purgatory) rebelled by posting his ‘Ninety-five Theses’ on the door of the Wittenberg Castle church. Simultaneously, he called upon lay people to take responsibility for their own salvation and to renounce Roman authority.
 * In Switzerland in 1523–1524, peasants in the Zurich district, using the argument that ruling authority should be based on the Scriptures, revolted against the town council, claiming that they should not be required to pay tithes on their produce because there was no biblical justification for doing so. Townsmen, with their own interpretation of the Bible, rejected the peasants’ demand, noting that the Bible did not forbid such payments, and said that the peasants should make them out of ‘love’. This so provoked the peasants that the revolt grew to hundreds of thousands in several countries. In 1525, territorial princes and large cities reacted by raising large armies that defeated and destroyed the revolt.
 * In 1535, in Münster, Germany, believing that protection of ‘true’ religion demanded harsh measures, Protestants, allied with the Catholic Church, persecuted and executed thousands of Anabaptists (a sect that believed only adults should be baptized, founded in 1525 by Konrad Grebel, Balthasar Hubmaier and others, and from whom the Baptists, Amish, Mennonites, Quakers and Hutterites of today are descended).
 * Between 1550 and 1650, about one hundred thousand people in Europe, mostly women, were persecuted for alleged witchcraft, and about sixty thousand were executed. Under torture, or the threat of torture, many confessions were obtained, but no proof that an accused person ever attended a Devil-worshipping ‘black’ Sabbath was ever produced in any witch trial.
 * From 1618 to 1648, the Thirty Years’ War was fought between Protestant and Catholic states in the Holy Roman Empire (comprised largely of present-day Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic) with considerable opportunistic meddling by surrounding countries. The war ended with the Peace of Westphalia (1648), which required that all subjects follow their rulers’ faiths.
 * Many Christians willingly joined the Nazis in trying to exterminate the Jews during World War II. Islamic fundamentalists have declared holy war on ‘infidel’ nations, particularly on the powerful ones. Muslims, Jews and Christians continue to kill each other today.
 * On September 11, 2001, perceiving the U.S. to be anti-Islamic because of its support for the presumed anti-Islamic policies of Israel and other countries, Osama Bin Laden, an Islamic extremist headquartered in Afghanistan, directed co-ordinated suicide attacks by fanatical Muslims on the World Trade Centre in New York City and on the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly three thousand people. These attacks inspired the following exchange on September 13, 2001 between Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson (see above) on Pat Robertson’s cable television program, *The 700 Club* (as reported by various websites):

<div class=indented>

Falwell: What we saw on Tuesday, as terrible as it is, could be miniscule if, in fact, God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America to give us probably what we deserve.  
Robertson: Well, Jerry, that’s my feeling. I think we've just seen the antechamber to terror, we haven’t begun to see what they can do to the major population.  
Falwell: “The ACLU has got to take a lot of blame for this. And I know I’ll hear from them for this, but throwing God… successfully with the help of the federal court system… throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools, the abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked and when we destroy forty million little innocent babies, we make God mad… I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way, all of them who try to secularise America… I point the thing in their face and say you helped this happen.”  
Robertson: “I totally concur, and the problem is we’ve adopted that agenda at the highest levels of our government, and so we’re responsible as a free society for what the top people do, and the top people, of course, is the court system.”  
Falwell: “Pat, did you notice yesterday that the ACLU and all the Christ-haters, the People for the American Way, NOW, etc., were totally disregarded by the Democrats and the Republicans in both houses of Congress, as they went out on the steps and called out to God in prayer and sang God bless America and said, let the ACLU be hanged. In other words, when the nation is on its knees, the only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do is what we ought to be doing all the time, calling on God.”

 * In late August 2005, hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast of the U.S. and caused more than 1300 confirmed deaths. On September 1, 2005, Pat Robertson (see above) proclaimed on *The 700 Club* that “New Orleans asked for this tragedy by advertising itself as a destination for jazz music. As every Christian knows, jazz music is sinful and lures people into eternal damnation. The connection is obvious”.^[from [Pat Robertson Corrects Dateline Hollywood Article](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113075159/http://datelinehollywood.com/archives/2005/09/18/pat-roberston-corrects-dateline-hollywood-article/)] Reverend Franklin Graham (see above), son of Reverend Billy Graham, suggests the city was targeted because of the city’s sinful reputation. At a speech in Virginia, he said, “This is one wicked city, OK? It’s known for Mardi Gras, for Satan worship. It’s known for sex perversion. It’s known for every type of drugs and alcohol and the orgies and all of these things that go on down there in New Orleans”. Reverend Graham continued, “There’s been a black spiritual cloud over New Orleans for years. They believe God is going to use that storm to bring revival”.^[from [Hurricane Katrina: Wrath of God?](http://web.archive.org/web/20120721125450/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9600878/)]
 * As a result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the removal of Saddam Hussein as dictator, Shiite Muslims waged civil war against Sunni Muslims in revenge for the atrocities committed by the Sunnis under the leadership of Hussein.
 * In *Silent No More* (2005), Rod Parsley (see above) says, “I cannot tell you how important it is that we understand the true nature of Islam, that we see it for what it really is. In fact, I will tell you this: I do not believe our country can truly fulfill its divine purpose until we understand our historical conflict with Islam. I know that this statement sounds extreme, but I do not shrink from its implications. The fact is that America was founded, in part, with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed, and I believe September 11, 2001, was a generational call to arms that we can no longer ignore”.
 * In *Jerusalem Countdown* (2006), John Hagee (see above) says, “The final battle for Jerusalem is about to begin. Every day in the media you are watching the gathering storm over the State of Israel. The winds of war are once again about to sweep through the sacred city of Jerusalem. The world is about to discover the power of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the Keeper of Israel, ‘who… shall neither slumber nor sleep’ (Ps. 121:4). His righteous fury will be evident in the defence of Israel”.

## 14.3. A non-dualistic view of God

In chapter 19 of *I Am That* (1988), Nisargadatta Maharaj says:

>When you see the world you see God. There is no seeing God apart from the world. Beyond the world to see God is to be God. The light by which you see the world, which is God, is the tiny little spark, ‘I am’, apparently so small, yet the first and the last in every act of knowing and loving.
