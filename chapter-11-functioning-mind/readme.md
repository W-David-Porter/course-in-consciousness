## 11.1 The nature of duality

In the meditation for May 21 in *A Net of Jewels* (1996), Ramesh says:

>It must be constantly borne in mind while trying to understand the mechanics of the apparent process of manifestation that nothing has actually been created. All that appears is mind-stuff, that of which all dreams are made, and apart from Consciousness itself, nothing exists, neither the mind nor the senses nor their objects.

In the meditation for May 20, he says:

>In one’s natural, immediate attention or awareness there are no boundaries, no separate items of manifestation, unless and until thought intrudes and directs specific concentration on a particular thing. And this is what creates separation along with the whole chain of other thoughts and reactions that lead to every kind of conflict and unhappiness, which we then interpret as bondage. But the realisation that boundaries are a product of thought is at once the realisation that the separation caused by these boundaries and the conflicts that ensue are all an illusion.

In the meditation for October 29, he says:

>The entire manifestation is purely conceptual. Nothing has actually ever been created, and nothing has ever been destroyed.

On p. 42 of *The Elements of Buddhism* (1990), John Snelling says:

A primary cause of suffering is delusion: our inability, because of subtly willful blindness, to see things the way they truly are but instead in a distorted way. The world is in fact a seamless and dynamic unity, a single living organism that is constantly undergoing change. Our minds, however, chop it up into separate, static bits and pieces, which we then try mentally and physically to manipulate. One of the mind’s most dear creations is the idea of the person and, closest to home, of a very special person which each one of us calls ‘I’: a separate, enduring ego or self. There is ‘I’ — and there is all the rest. That means conflict — and pain, for ‘I’ cannot control that fathomless vastness against which it is set. It will try, of course, as a flea might pit itself against an elephant, but it is a vain enterprise.

In this chapter, we shall depart from the trend of Chapters 9 and 10 by focusing our attention on the world instead of on what we really are. However, it will be helpful for the reader to keep in mind the lesson of those chapters, viz., that there is nothing but Consciousness. Everything else is a concept. But, in order to continue our course, we must attempt to conceptualise that which cannot be conceptualised.

In [Section 8.2](/chapter-8-transcendental-realms#_8-2-the-meaning-of-the-transcendental-realms), we saw that the conventional concept of objective reality rests on shaky grounds. In [Section 9.2](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising#_9-2-what-is-the-perceived), we saw that all separation between objects is purely conceptual because there is no separation within the wholeness of Consciousness. Likewise, we saw in [Section 9.3](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising#_9-3-what-is-the-perceiver) that the separation between pure Subjectivity (Awareness) and pure objectivity is also purely conceptual. These are examples of the way we shall use concepts to point to what is beyond concepts.

Since concepts are formed by splitting off one part of the whole from the rest, they invariably come in the form of polar pairs, that is, of pairs of inseparable opposites (e.g., ‘I’ and not-‘I’). A pair forms an indivisible whole. Thus, the two opposites must always appear together, and are conceived from what is inconceivable. Since wholeness appears to have been broken, non-duality appears to have been replaced by duality. However, this is only an appearance, a result of conceptualisation, since Consciousness is always intrinsically whole.

The appearance of duality implies a boundary line between one part and its opposite. As we shall soon see, one of the inevitable consequences of any boundary line is its potential to become a battle line, with all of the suffering that it entails.

All polar pairs, or dualities, are only conceptualisations in mind, and come and go in mind without affecting Consciousness, just as a reflection can come and go without affecting its source. All conceptual phenomena are merely reflections of Consciousness in Consciousness (the metaphor of [Section 13.9](/chapter-13-some-useful-metaphors#_13-9-the-dust-in-a-light-beam)). They are the restless waves that appear on the silent sea (the metaphor of [Section 13.4](/chapter-13-some-useful-metaphors#_13-4-the-shadow).

The yin/yang symbol of ancient Chinese philosophy^[see, e.g., [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang)] shown below (except for the captions) is a striking representation of duality within non-duality. It graphically shows how non-duality (the outer circle) appears to be broken into the two polar opposites, yin (dark) and yang (light). Each part contains the seed (a small dot) of the other part, representing the ease with which yin/yang can change into yang/yin. The boundary line between the two represents potential conflict, while non-duality itself is never disturbed by any appearances within it. In Chinese philosophy, yin signifies the female (moon) principle, and yang signifies the male (sun) principle, but, more generally, they represent any pair of polar opposites.

## 11.2. The appearance of sentience within Consciousness

We have seen two objective explanations of how the world appears out of the transcendental: 1) wave-function collapse, given in [Section 7.3](/chapter-7-summary-critique-amit-goswami-interpretation-quantum-theory-within-monistic-idealism#_7-3-the-world-in-idealism); and 2) manifestation from the transcendental realms of Nisargadatta and Ramesh, given in [Section 8.1](/chapter-8-transcendental-realms#_8-1-similarities-between-the-different-transcendental-realms). Both concepts have the logical difficulties that are discussed in [Section 8.2](/chapter-8-transcendental-realms#_8-2-the-meaning-of-the-transcendental-realms). A simpler, more general, and more verifiable concept is that the manifestation simply appears when sentience appears within Consciousness.
