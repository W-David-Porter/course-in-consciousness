# Chapter 16. Love Seeking Itself

[[TOC]]

In this chapter, we shall discover that our true nature includes not only pure Awareness but also Love, both of which are aspects of the same Reality.

Christianity teaches that God is Love:

>He who does not love does not know God; for God is love (*1 John* 4:8).

And:

>No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us (*1 John* 4:12).

The love that was taught by Jesus, called agape (ah-**gah**-pay), is unconditional, altruistic love. Jesus taught his disciples to love others, with the ultimate goal being universal love. For example, in *John* 15:12, he says:

>This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.

Note: this is quite different from *Mark* 12:31:

>Love your neighbour as yourself

because, what if you hate yourself?

Agape is love that challenges the spiritual person to “love your enemies”, or to “love without thought of return”. It is a love that flows out to others in the form of compassion, kindness, tenderness and charity. (Note: Charity does not always imply material giving. Giving of attention may be more meaningful than giving money or goods.)

Buddhism teaches that love consists of the “four Sublime States”:^[see, e.g., Walpole Rahula, *What The Buddha Taught* (1959) p.75] 

 1. Extending unlimited, universal love and good-will to all living beings without any kind of discrimination; 
 2. Compassion for all living beings who are suffering, in trouble and affliction; 
 3. Sympathetic joy in others’ success, welfare and happiness; and 
 4. Equanimity in all vicissitudes of life.

Note: Objectively speaking, compassion for others may be associated with the action of ‘mirror neurons’ in the brain.^[*Empathy and the Somatotopic Auditory Mirror System in Humans*, by V. Gazzola, L. Aziz-Zadeh, C. Keysers, *Current Biology* 16 (2006) 1824–29] Mirror neurons, known to exist in humans and in macaque monkeys, activate when an action is either observed or heard. If you either observe somebody eating an apple or hear the sound of somebody eating an apple, some of the same neurons fire as when you eat the apple yourself. It is not difficult to imagine a similar thing happening when suffering in another is observed. Similarly, brain scans have shown that the same region of the brain is activated when voluntary donations are made to charitable organisations as when the participant receives the same amount of money as a reward.^[*Human fronto-mesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation*, J. Moll, F. Krueger, R. Zahn, M. Pardini, R. de Oliveira-Souza, J. Grafman, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* 103 (2006) 15623–28]

In *Everyday Mind* (1997), Buddhist meditation teacher Joseph Goldstein says:

<div class=indented>

The expression of emptiness is love, because emptiness means ‘emptiness of self’. When there is no self, there is no other. That duality is created by the idea of self, of I, of ego. When there’s no self, there is a unity, a communion. And without the thought of “I’m loving someone”, love becomes the natural expression of that oneness.

Hinduism has a branch of *yoga*, the heart-centred path of *Bhakta* ([Section 10.3](/chapter-10-teaching-non-duality/#_10-3-the-paths)), which leads to enlightenment through an overwhelming love for God that takes the form of loving all of humanity. The Chinese religions Taoism and Confucianism see transcendent love as an essential part of true wisdom.

Sufism is the inner, mystical, psycho-spiritual dimension of Islam. The essence of Sufi practice is to surrender to God, embracing at each moment one’s thoughts, feelings, emotions, body sensations and perceptions as manifestations of God. Among *Sufi* practices is a chant with the following words:^[from [Sufi Concentrations, James Burgess](https://www.jamesburgess.com/uploads/4/0/0/8/4008580/10_love_lover.pdf)]

*Ishq Allah Mahbud Lillah* (x4)  
God is love, lover, and beloved  
Love, lover, and beloved  
I am love, lover, and beloved  
Love, lover, and beloved  

</div>

Since all religions and spiritualities teach the value, power and necessity of love, we must ask, what is the role of love in *Advaita*? In order to answer this question, one must distinguish between what the world thinks is love, and what Love really is as seen by the sage. According to the sage, Love is a term that can be used to describe Consciousness expressing itself as the manifestation. In enlightenment, this is seen directly (see [Chapter 25](/chapter-25-love-finding-itself/)).

On page 88 of *Be As You Are* (1985) by David Godman, Ramana Maharshi is quoted as saying:

>Only if one knows the truth of love, which is the real nature of the Self, will the strong entangled knot of life be untied. Only if one attains the height of love will liberation be attained. Such is the heart of all religions. The experience of Self is only love, which is seeing only love, hearing only love, feeling only love, tasting only love and smelling only love, which is bliss.

Ramesh has said:

>The presence of separation is the absence of love, and the presence of love is the absence of separation.

In the meditation for January 13 in *A Net of Jewels* (1996), he paraphrases his guru Nisargadatta (cf. the second quote by Nisargadatta below):

>It is only when you arrive at the deepest conviction that the same life flows through everything, and that you ARE that life, that you can begin to love naturally and spontaneously.

In the meditation for January 18, he says:

>Love as the word is generally understood, denotes separation, whereas in true non-objective relationship we do not love others, we ARE others.

In *As It Is* (2000), Tony Parsons says:

>All and everything emanates from silence and unconditional love.

In *The Wisdom of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj* (1992) by Robert Powell, Nisargadatta Maharaj is quoted as saying:

>When all the false self-identifications are thrown away, what remains is all-embracing love.

In *The Ultimate Understanding* (2001), page 180, Ramesh says that Love is more accurately called ‘harmony’ or ‘beatitude’. In *The Seeking* (2004), page 77, he said that the feeling to do something for someone without expecting something in return could be called Love.

Non-dualistic love is pointed to by Francis Lucille:

<div class=indented>

What is love? The word ‘love’ refers to a lived experience. It is a paradoxical experience because even though we have all experienced the reality of it, it appears to escape every attempt to grasp it, to describe it or to repeat it. The tender delight we had in our childhood when we looked at a beautiful coloured illustration, the soft emotion when we think about a loved one, the impulse that moves us to encourage a stranger in deep sorrow and to help when in danger, the repulsion that grips us when cruelty is committed against oppressed innocence. All these circumstances among many others point to a common experience that cannot be described or defined. If we want to go deeper into the discovery of this central experience it seems that our investigation evaporates due to a lack of objective support. If we do not have the words to express it and there are no images to describe it, it is because there are no perceptions or sensations to experience it objectively. Nevertheless we do have this experience. That is the paradox: it is unmistakably present. It has the same undeniable and ethereal character as conscious presence. We know this experience in the same way we know that we are conscious. 

If we try to describe the trajectory up to the very last moment where it crosses over into the inexpressible, it seems as if the ‘I’ feeling dissolves, perhaps only temporarily, into a more spacious reality, infinite, a blessed peace that brings an end to all the emotional or intellectual agitation. We are not strangers to this new dimension. It is not the discovery of a spiritual America. It is immediately recognised as absolute intimacy and tenderness. It is the centre of our self and the world, simultaneously. This presence is love. 

Is there some particular condition before this quality of authentic love and compassion is revealed? The condition is the temporary or permanent disappearance of the idea of a separate ‘I’. This disappearance can never be the result of an action done by this ‘I’. Love flies on its own wings and knows no laws. It is the emergence of grace that wrests us from the hypnosis of separation. Liberation arises out of freedom itself. But you should not conclude from this that every act and practice intended to establish us as love is useless. Such a decision would confine us to intellectual dullness. The longing for love comes from love itself, not from the separate ego. On the contrary, we have to surrender to everything that takes us to love. In this surrender we discover true life, the inner peace that we have always sought.

Can love exist without an object?

Love exists only without an object. Love is the love of the objectless by the objectless. An object puts clothes on love, and dressed veils it. What we love in a person is neither the physical body nor the thoughts. It is the conscious presence that we have in common with him, the self, the objectless. The veil can exercise a temporary power of attraction, but only the true self that remains in the background can bring us what we seek. We don’t love the other, we love the love in the other. This does not mean that we have to turn away from the other to turn towards God, the objectless, but rather that we see the other as an expression of love. Relations with our partner, son or daughter, a stranger, a foreigner then take on another dimension. Daily life becomes a field of experience that is forever new. If we approach the other as potential divine consciousness, we force God to remove the mask, which he does with a miracle; and the miracle is the smile of God.^[[Love in the Other: Francis Lucille](http://www.stillnessspeaks.com/images/uploaded/file/Love%20in%20the%20Other%20Francis%20Lucille.pdf)]

The above phrases are all pointers, not descriptors, because non-dualistic Love cannot be described. It is not something we do — It is an aspect of our true nature. Self-realisation means to realise our true nature as Awareness/Love. We who still see ourselves as individuals are usually unaware that non-dualistic love is What-We-Are. Religion sometimes points to it, but since Love is not a concept or rule of behaviour, it cannot be packaged in a doctrine and taught.

(That the manifestation is an expression of Love is reflected in our felt need to communicate with each other. Communication is difficult without a commonly accepted and understood language. The universally used language of communication is the concept of objective reality. For this reason, we can think of objective reality as nothing more than a communication device. Objective reality need not exist as Reality. To believe that it is real is to believe that separation is real but, if separation is real, unconditional Love is impossible. This leads to the paradox of communication: The need to communicate is an expression of Love, but if the need to communicate fosters a belief in separation, it makes Love impossible.)

Non-dual Love is the clear seeing that everything, without exception, is an expression of Itself. This includes all of the feelings and emotions that we suppress, including the suppressing itself, and all of the actions or speech that we wish we could take back, as well as the wishing itself. Nothing is excluded in the expression of non-dual Love. Furthermore, what may seem to be just the opposite of Love is still just an expression of Love. 

For the coming week, practice seeing that everything is an expression of Love. Remember that any failure to see this is also just an expression of Love. See if this way of looking at your life changes anything, but remember that, whether there is change or no change, it is still an expression of Love. In the end, perhaps nothing will change except your way of looking at it, but you may then realise that that is the most profound kind of change that could ever occur.
:::

How is non-dualistic love different from dualistic love? Non-dualistic love is not an emotion but transcends all emotions, is always unconditional since it recognises no change, and is impersonal since it recognises no person. Being non-dualistic, it has no opposite and it transcends all objects so it cannot be directed towards any object.

On the other hand, since the perception of separation is the distinguishing feature of spiritual ignorance, dualistic love is based on the desire–fear polarity. It always involves attachment to the love object (e.g., the lover), which makes suffering inescapable when circumstances, such as the change or disappearance of the love object, require detaching from it. Being half of the love–hate duality, dualistic love easily switches to hate. It is highly personal and can take the form of pleasure, completeness, joy, desire, loneliness, jealousy, possession, guilt, responsibility, need, identification, subjugation or submission. Because it is an emotion or sentiment that is felt while perceiving separation, it is in a different realm entirely from non-dualistic love. However, since non-dualistic love is the background of everything in manifestation, even dualistic love partakes of it while remaining largely unaware of it.

On page 91 of *The Road Less Travelled* (1978), psychiatrist M. Scott Peck says:

<div class=indented>

To serve as effectively as it does to trap us into marriage, the experience of falling in love probably must have as one of its characteristics the illusion that the experience will last forever. This illusion is fostered in our culture by the commonly held myth of romantic love, which has its origins in our favourite childhood fairy tales, wherein the prince and princess, once united, live happily forever after. The myth of romantic love tells us, in effect, that for every young man in the world there is a young woman who was ‘meant for him’, and vice versa. Moreover, the myth implies that there is only one man meant for a woman and only one woman for a man and this has been predetermined ‘in the stars’. When we meet the person for whom we are intended, recognition comes through the fact that we fall in love. We have met the person for whom all the heavens intended us, and since the match is perfect, we will then be able to satisfy all of each other’s needs forever and ever, and therefore live happily forever after in perfect union and harmony.

In a travesty of Love as Reality, love is often depicted in popular culture as more torment than peace. Witness, e.g., the mournful wail of lost, unrequited or secret love in the ‘love’ songs of popular and country music. (In fact, the suicide rate among devotees of country music is higher than that of the general public.^[*The Effect of Country Music on Suicide*, S. Stach and J. Gundlach, Social Forces 71 (1992) 211-218]) Many singers have become professional sufferers in an effort to make their music sound authentic. And the story of love in the movies is often an agony of ecstasy, insecurity and guilt, until the story ends at a marriage — if not the first marriage, the next… or the next…

Personal love relationships have been called special relationships because they occur only between specific people in special circumstances. They are conditional and changing, but all are a form of bondage because they are always infected by power struggles (see [Section 11.4](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-4-objectification-the-second-level-of-identification), [Section 11.5](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-5-ownership-the-third-level-of-identification), [Section 11.6](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-6-polar-pairs-separation-and-suffering), [Section 11.7](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-7-the-victim-victimiser-polar-pair)), and are invariably guilt-ridden (see [Section 11.8](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-8-sin-guilt-and-shame-%E2%80%94-monstrosities-of-mind)). Furthermore, because they are barter relationships, they depend on the mutual satisfaction of expectations and demands. When these are met, there is temporary gratification, gratitude, and enhanced self-esteem, but when they are ignored or refused, there is dismay, rejection and guilt. Because barter relationships can survive only as long as each side has, and is willing to give, something the other wants, many personal love relationships end in disillusion. Others, after a long period of partly met and partly disappointed expectations, settle down to resigned acceptance (not true acceptance, see [Section 19.2](/chapter-19-surrender-mantra-trust/#_19-2-ramesh%E2%80%99s-teaching-on-surrender) and [Chapter 22](/chapter-22-disidentification-from-attachment-aversion/)). Still others, after surviving their initial specialness, approach the unconditional nature of non-dualistic love.

In romantic love, the much-sought ‘soul mate’ is an illusion, being the projection of the wants and needs of one person on the other, who seems to be the missing half of a duality (‘opposites attract’). Ironically, when the soul mate is finally found and possessed, the ego feels even more needy and incomplete. (Here, we shall speak as though the ego exists, while knowing that it does not.) It fears the loss of both the other and itself. Guilt and anxiety are seen as necessary parts of this ‘love’, both for their intensity (‘love hurts’), and as tools to manipulate the other (“if you really loved me you would…”). So as not to lose the other, the ego may become neurotically dependent (“I can’t live without you”) or remorseful (“please forgive me”), or it make promises (“I’ll never do it again”). And it may try to regain its lost self-esteem by inducing jealousy (“if you don't love me, I’ll find somebody who will”) or by belittling (“without me you would be nothing”).

Second, as best you can, describe the experience of your first romantic love. Did it seem compelling and irresistible? Did it surprise you? Was it more or less what you expected? How would you describe the relative degrees of physical, mental and emotional content in it? Has any other love matched it or exceeded it? Are you glad, or not, that you had the experience? Would you prefer that any love you experience from now on be less personal and more impersonal? If so, why? If not, why not?

Love as a practice is necessarily dualistic because of the assumed separation between lover and beloved. The purpose of such a practice is ultimately to see what non-dualistic Love is (‘fake it until you make it’). Love as a practice comes as half of the love–hate dualism, so the practitioner often feels failure, frustration, guilt and fear until is it seen that non-dualistic Love is not something you can do. Love just is (see [Chapter 25](/chapter-25-love-finding-itself/)).

In chapter 46 of *I Am That* (1984), Nisargadatta (Ramesh’s guru) says:

>Do not pretend that you love others as yourself. Unless you have realised them as one with yourself, you cannot love them. Don’t pretend to be what you are not, don’t refuse to be what you are. Your love of others is the result of self-knowledge, not its cause. Without self-realisation, no virtue is genuine. When you know beyond all doubting that the same life flows through all that is and you are that life, you will love all naturally and spontaneously. When you realise the depth and fullness of your love of yourself, you know that every living being and the entire universe are included in your affection. But when you look at anything as separate from you, you cannot love it for you are afraid of it. Alienation causes fear, and fear deepens alienation. It is a vicious circle. Only self-realisation can break it.

An exalted form of dualistic love is identification with another person. This can occur in marital and familial relationships. It can also occur in *Bhakti*, the practice of devotion and surrender to God or guru (see [Section 10.3](/chapter-10-teaching-non-duality/#_10-3-the-paths)).

Because intuition is the link between separation and wholeness, it is intuition that gives us a sense of identification with the other even within the illusion of separation.

Identification with another is perhaps as close as we can come to non-dualistic Love while still retaining a belief in separation. The less separation there is, the more unconditional love there is. As separation vanishes, we begin to see each other as ourselves. Indeed, unconditional love can be described as seeing others as ourselves.

Subjectively, identification with another may be a product of non-local of mind, as defined in [Section 12.2](/chapter-12-space-time-causality-destiny/#_12-2-speculations-on-the-concepts-of-nonlocality-in-time-and-space). Objectively, the feeling of closeness and identity that many people experience with each other might be due to the overlap of their subtle bodies, as was also suggested in [Section 12.2](/chapter-12-space-time-causality-destiny/#_12-2-speculations-on-the-concepts-of-nonlocality-in-time-and-space). Those who are able to sense auras can easily sense when one person’s aura expands to include another person’s.

A common experience among spiritual seekers is the feeling of peace and serenity that prevails in an *ashram* or other gathering of seekers. This is especially so during a silent retreat when the ego has no chance to assert itself through conversation. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (b. ca. 1915, d. 2008), the founder of Transcendental Meditation, has elevated this effect into a guiding principle, which he calls the ‘Maharishi Effect’ (see [Section 5.2](/chapter-5-conscious-mind-free-will/#_5-2-extraordinary-abilities-of-the-mind)). This states that, when a group of people are meditating together, they create a harmonious, tranquil influence that is felt not only by the meditators, but also by anybody else in their vicinity. He has even formulated it into a quantitative principle — the number of people whose mental states are harmonised by a group of meditating people is equal to one hundred times the square of the number of people meditating.

The harmonious tranquillity of non-local mind experienced in a spiritual community is extremely important for spiritual growth. Without this experience, it is easy to feel stagnation, frustration and dryness. This is what Jesus meant when he said in *Matthew* 18:20:

>For where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst.

Some spiritual teachers (e.g., Gangaji) speak of a single, profound experience of awakening that occurred while they were in the presence of their master. They call this phenomenon ‘transmission’, and it might result from the overlap of subtle bodies discussed above (see also [Section 18.4](/chapter-18-practices-teachers/#_18-4-who-or-what-is-it-that-practices)). Other teachers say it happens more gradually over time. Some teachers (e.g., Francis Lucille) at times call it the ‘direct path’ (but this is only one form of the direct path, see another in [Section 23.4](/chapter-23-disidentification-through-inquiry/#_23-4-there-is-no-suffering-in-the-present-moment)). Ramesh has called it ‘magic’, and says on page 142 of his book, *Peace and Harmony in Daily Living* (2003):

>…the average person experiences a certain kind of peace and relaxation in the sage’s company and he realises that this has rarely anything to do with what is talked about during the meeting. The very presence of the man of wisdom seems to exude peace and harmony in spite of the fact that he seems to respond to outside events with an absolutely normal reaction!

Many people have attested that the experience of being in the Presence of the sage is enlivening and rarely boring.

We now present a heuristic hypothesis about non-local mind: The more disidentified the mind, the more non-local it is and the larger is its subtle body (see [Section 12.2](/chapter-12-space-time-causality-destiny/#_12-2-speculations-on-the-concepts-of-nonlocality-in-time-and-space)). The more identified the mind, the less non-local it is and the smaller is its subtle body. This might mean that a disidentified mind could catalyse disidentification in an identified mind. Thus, disidentified mind might make possible both the ‘Maharishi Effect’ among meditators, and transmission from sage to disciple.

In The *Self-Aware Universe* (1993), Amit Goswami has suggested that, if the brain has a quantum part, non-local mind might be an effect of a Bell-Aspect type of correlation (see [Section 4.3](/chapter-4-waves-interference/#_4-3-bell%E2%80%99s-theorem-the-aspect%E2%80%93groblacher-experiments-and-the-non-locality-of-reality) and [Section 7.4](chapter-7-summary-critique-amit-goswami-interpretation-quantum-theory-within-monistic-idealism/#_7-4-the-quantum%E2%80%93classical-brain)). From this we might speculate that, if two people are initially in substantial mental agreement or alignment when they are in close proximity, their quantum brains might overlap, and a correlation might be established that could persist even if they became separated by large distances. Perhaps this correlation would be experienced as love.

Following is a beautiful example of non-local mind and unconditional love given by Sharon Salzberg:

<div class=indented>

Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche lived in Paris when I first met him. The room was alive and vibrant with Khenpo laughing, teasing and playing with the children. The moment I saw him a constriction in my heart eased, one that I hadn’t even realised was there. He looked up at me, and as soon as our eyes met I felt I’d come home. The light I sensed coming out of him was brighter than even the most extravagant colour of the walls surrounding us.

Khenpo was the most spacious person I’d ever met. It seemed as though the wind passed right through his translucent being. Many times in his company I had the strange sense that we were standing in a wide open field, great empty expanses spreading out in all directions. Yet he was entirely unself-conscious like a magician unattached to his own magic.

He taught me that in letting go of our burdensome desires for acquisition and performance, we can just let the mind rest in ease. As he would put it, ― Rest in natural great peace, this exhausted mind.^[[Influences — Sharon Salberg](https://www.sharonsalzberg.com/influences/#attachment_11015)]

On page 155 of *The Dalai Lama: A Policy of Kindness* (1990), the Dalai Lama says:

>True happiness comes not from a limited concern for one’s own well-being, or that of those one feels close to, but from developing love and compassion for all sentient beings. Here, love means wishing that all sentient beings should find happiness, and compassion means wishing that they should all be free of suffering. The development of this attitude gives rise to a sense of openness and trust that provides the basis for peace.

Love, whether dualistic or non-dualistic, always includes acceptance. Acceptance of Totality as it is in every moment is one of the characteristics of whole mind, (see [Chapter 19](/chapter-19-surrender-mantra-trust/)). Even in split mind, the more acceptance there is, the less separation and the more love (see [Chapter 22](/chapter-22-disidentification-from-attachment-aversion/)).

Ardent non-dualistic Love can be present even while the perception of separation still exists. An example is the all-encompassing yearning for Reality (or God) by the seeker (see [Section 17.3](/chapter-17-how-live-ones-life/#_17-3-meaning-and-purpose-in-life)). This is Love seeking Itself. (For a discussion of Love finding Itself, see [Chapter 25](/chapter-25-love-finding-itself/)).
