## 8.1. Similarities between the different transcendental realms

So far, we have encountered two transcendental realms, that of Plato’s cave allegory (see [Section 1.4](/chapter-1-three-major-metaphysical-philosophies#_1-4-idealism-pure-subjectivity-the-philosophy-that-consciousness-is-all-and-all-is-consciousness)), and that of Goswami’s quantum theory within monistic idealism (see [Chapter 7](/chapter-7-summary-critique-amit-goswami-interpretation-quantum-theory-within-monistic-idealism/)). Now we shall consider three other transcendental realms, one by the sage Nisargadatta Maharaj, one by the sage Ramesh Balsekar and one by Buddhism.

In chapter 76 of *I Am That* (1984), Nisargadatta says:

>The memory of the past unfulfilled desires traps energy, which manifests itself as a person. When its charge gets exhausted, the person dies. Unfulfilled desires are carried over into the next birth. Self-identification with body creates ever-fresh desires and there is no end to them unless this mechanism of bondage is clearly seen. It is clarity that is liberating, for you cannot abandon desire unless its causes and effects are clearly seen. I do not say that the same person is reborn. It dies, and dies for good. But its memories remain and their desires and fears. They supply the energy for a new person.

Nisargadatta’s concept has been reformulated by one of his students, Ramesh Balsekar, whose teaching will receive much emphasis in this course. Ramesh uses a concept of the source and sink for the manifestation that is similar to the other transcendental realms. He calls it the ‘pool of consciousness’ and it implicitly contains all of the forms from which consciousness ‘selects’ the components for an object of manifestation such as a body–mind organism. On p. 78 of *Consciousness Writes* (1994), Ramesh says:

>The future body’s personality will be drawn from the totality of the universal consciousness, which is the collection of all of the “clouds of images’ that keep on getting generated. This total collection gets distributed among new bodies as they are being created, with certain given characteristics which will produce precisely those actions which are necessary to the script of the divine playwright. No individual is concerned as an individual with any previous entity.

At the death of the organism, the mental conditioning that was present in the organism, such as thoughts, fears, desires, aversions and ambitions, return to the pool where they become ingredients to be used by consciousness in creating new forms.

The Buddha taught a similar idea about rebirth. On p. 33 of *What the Buddha Taught* (1974), Walpola Rahula says

<div class=indented>
What we call death is the total non-functioning of the physical body. Do all these forces and energies stop altogether with the non-functioning of the body? Buddhism says, “No”. Will, volition, desire, thirst to exist, to continue, to become more and more, is a tremendous force that moves whole lives, whole existences, that even moves the whole world. This is the greatest force, the greatest energy in the whole world. According to Buddhism, this force does not stop with the non-functioning of the body, which is death; but it continues manifesting itself in another form, producing re-existence, which is called rebirth.

Non-locality in time means that some non-local minds are sensitive to projections from the transcendental that include some aspects of past and/or future. This would explain those talented individuals that can read the ‘akashic records’ and thus see past lives, or those that are precognitive and can see some aspects of the future. Non-locality in space means that some non-local minds are sensitive to projections from the transcendental of images of locations far outside the direct perception of that individual. The inevitable inaccuracy and unreliability of such non-local projections can be explained by realising that only part of the transcendental realm is projected.

:::tip Questions
Do you know somebody who claims to be precognitive? Somebody who claims to be clairvoyant? Somebody who claims to remember past lives? Is there any way to verify that these claims are true?

We can now see the similarities between the different transcendental realms. All of them transcend space–time, but all are the source of space–time and of the entire manifestation. In each moment the entire manifestation arises and dissolves, to be replaced by the manifestation of the next moment. These processes of manifestation and dissolution go on continuously. (This process is directly observable by advanced Buddhist meditators, see Section 14.5, Section 14.6, Section 24.2.)
