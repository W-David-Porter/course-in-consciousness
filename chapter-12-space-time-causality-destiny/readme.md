## 12.1. The concepts of space and time

In the meditation for April 12 in *A Net of Jewels* (1996), Ramesh says:

>The crux of man’s dilemma lies in the concept of time. While chasing his mythical happiness of the future, man has no time to enjoy the present moment. And actually there is no such thing as the present because by the time one thinks of it, it has already become the past. Therefore, what is vital is not thinking about the present but actually being the present moment — and that is nothing other than enlightenment.

In chapter 66 of *I Am That* (1984), Nisargadatta Maharaj says:

>It is the clinging to the false that makes the true so difficult to see. Once you understand that the false needs time and what needs time is false, you are nearer the Reality, which is timeless, ever in the now. Eternity in time is mere repetitiveness, like the movement of a clock. It flows from the past into the future endlessly, an empty perpetuity. Reality is what makes the present so vital, so different from the past and future, which are merely mental. If you need time to achieve something, it must be false. The real is always with you; you need not wait to be what you are.

And in chapter 100, he says:

>Before the mind, I am. “I am” is not a thought in the mind; the mind happens to me, I do not happen to the mind. And since time and space are in the mind, I am beyond time and space, eternal and omnipresent.

Consciousness is all there is. The reality of Awareness/Presence is not a concept. Everything else is. Space is a concept that is no more real than the objects that appear in it. The concept of the three dimensions of space allows the concept of three-dimensional objects to appear. All spatial objects are purely conceptual, including the human body.

The conceptual nature of space is clarified if we think of the difference between the sense of ‘hereness’ (the sense of hereness/nowness is called the sense of Presence) and the concept of ‘here’. The concept ‘here’ implies the concept ‘there’, which is equivalent to ‘not here’. Thus, the unbroken wholeness of hereness has been conceptually divided into two parts, here and there. Without the concept of space, there is only the wholeness of hereness.

Without the concept of three-dimensional space, there is no concept of three-dimensional depth, so all spatial forms appear at the same ‘depth’ in the mind. This immediately becomes clear when we close our eyes and everything appears at the same depth. With our eyes closed, there is no occlusion of one object by another as there is with our eyes open. When we open our eyes again, thoughts and ‘external’ objects seem to appear at different depths. However, since there is no intrinsic difference between thought and perception (see [Section 9.2](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising/#_9-2-what-is-the-perceived)), without the concept of depth, thoughts and objects both appear at the same depth.

:::tip Exercise
Close your eyes and see if objects (images) appear at different depths. What do you see?
:::

Because the body is bilateral, we conceptualise space into left/right. Because gravity and our sense of balance keep us right-side-up, we conceptualise space into up/down. However, even with our eyes closed and there are no visual images, there are still body sensations (called proprioception) that give us the sense of horizontal and vertical orientation and movement.

::: Question
How can a blind person conceptualise depth?
:::

In the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, successive wave-function collapses (see [Section 6.3](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean/#_6-3-the-copenhagen-interpretation-a-partly-objective-and-partly-subjective-interpretation), [Section 6.4](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean/#_6-4-what-can-make-an-observation-in-the-copenhagen-interpretation)) allow the concept of change to appear. Because the concept of time depends on the concept of change, we have the equivalencies: time = change = duration = succession. The concept of time is complementary to the concept of space, and forms a fourth dimension that is perpendicular to the three spatial dimensions. As with space, it becomes clear that time is only a concept if we compare the sense of ‘nowness’ (from the sense of hereness/nowness) with the concept ‘now’. The concept ‘now’ implies the concept ‘then’, which is equivalent to ‘not now’. The unbroken wholeness of nowness has been broken into two parts, now and then. Without the concept of time, there is only the wholeness of nowness. One well-known attempt to point to the Reality that transcends conceptual space–time is the 1971 book by Ram Dass entitled *Be Here Now*. (Reportedly, at one time it was the third most popular book in English, next only to the Bible and Dr. Spock’s baby manual.)

The concept of time depends on the presence of thoughts of the past, thoughts of the present and thoughts of the future (see [Section 9.5](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising/#_9-5-objectification-the-body%E2%80%93mind-organism-and-the-primacy-of-the-concept-of-memory), 
[Chapter 10]()). Without a comparison between these three kinds of thoughts, we could not form the concept of change. Without the concept of change, there is no experience, so all thoughts, feelings, emotions, sensations, and perceptions are experiences that depend on a comparison between thoughts. Time can be conceptually divided into two major parts, past thoughts and future thoughts, which are inseparable polar opposites (this is a more conventional division than dividing it into now and then as in the previous paragraph). The concept of now becomes nothing more than a thought of the boundary between past thoughts and future thoughts. (The real now is not a boundary, but is ‘nowness’.)

:::tip Exercise
For the next few days, as often as you can remember it, practice being here now. What was your experience? Was it worth continuing the practice?
:::

:::tip Exercise
Close your eyes. Do you feel that you are in your head?
Again close your eyes. Now before thoughts and images arise, see if time exists for you. Do you feel that you are here, now in your head?
Again close your eyes, but now go inward and downward into the body. Do you feel that you are here, now in the whole body?
:::

Without the concepts of time and space, all further conceptualisation is impossible. In particular, the concept of the personal identity arises from the persistency of the concepts of the body–mind, personal doërship, and choice (see [Section 11.4](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-4-objectification-the-second-level-of-identification)). Without such persistency, the conceptual ‘I’ could not arise. Thus, the ‘I’ depends on the concept of time. In timelessness, there is no ‘I’.

We see only one thought at a time. Thoughts of the past, present and future are what give us the impression that time exists. If we could see them all simultaneously, the concept of time would not arise. (There is a remarkably accurate saying: “Time is what keeps everything from happening all at once”.) We may have visions of the ‘future’, even startlingly ‘real’ ones, but these occur only in the subjective present. The same is true of visions and memories of the ‘past’. These examples show that the ‘past’ and ‘future’ do not exist as separate eras but actually consist of thoughts in the subjective present, which is the only ‘time’ there is.

Consequently, just as there is no objective reality outside of the mind for space and the objects therein, there is no objective reality outside of the mind for time and the events therein (see [Section 9.2](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising/#_9-2-what-is-the-perceived)). Whatever past or future there is exists only as concepts in our minds.

:::tip Exercise 
 * In the teaching of non-duality, Consciousness is Awareness plus all of the arisings in Awareness. 
 * Awareness does not exist in space. Space is only a concept in Awareness.
 * Since space is only a concept, objects are not objectively separate from each other. 

Therefore, separation is not real. It is only a concept. 

These are pointers, not descriptors, because they point to something that cannot be described. Yet, that does not make what they point to any less real. In fact, it enhances its reality because we can directly see the truth of it ourselves. We do not need agreement from others. Ponder these pointers deeply. See if you can see directly what they point to. Can you see that your true nature is Awareness, not any objects of Awareness such as your thoughts, feelings, emotions, body sensations or perceptions? Can you see directly that space is only a concept in the mind? Can you see directly that separation is also only a concept in the mind?

## 12.2. Speculations on the concepts of nonlocality in time and space

The Bell–Aspect experiments described in [Section 4.3](/chapter-4-waves-interference/#_4-3-bell%E2%80%99s-theorem-the-aspect%E2%80%93groblacher-experiments-and-the-non-locality-of-reality) showed that faster-than-light correlations can occur between events at two different points in space (see also [Section 6.5](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean/#_6-5-wave-function-reduction-in-the-copenhagen-interpretation-the-forward-direction-of-time), [Section 6.6](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean/#_6-6-non-locality-in-the-copenhagen-interpretation), [Section 6.7](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean/#_6-7-the-many-worlds-interpretation-a-partly-objective-and-partly-subjective-interpretation)). This is what we meant by non-locality in space. However, in [Section 9.2](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising/#_9-2-what-is-the-perceived), we said that the mind does not exist in space–time but that space–time exists only as a concept in the mind. Thus, non-locality in space is nothing but a concept in the mind.

In [Section 5.2](/chapter-5-conscious-mind-free-will/#_5-2-extraordinary-abilities-of-the-mind), [Section 9.4](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising/#_9-4-many-minds-one-awareness), we discussed non-local mind. By non-local mind we mean different minds appearing within the context of non-local universal Consciousness (not in the context of space, which is in the mind). (This is a more precise definition of non-local mind than the one given in Section [Section 5.2](/chapter-5-conscious-mind-free-will/#_5-2-extraordinary-abilities-of-the-mind).) By virtue of non-local universal Consciousness, minds can communicate with each other even though they appear to spatially separate. That is why faster-than-light correlations can occur between what seem to be widely separated regions of space.

Note: If space is assumed to be objective rather than subjective, there appear to be two different types of non-locality (see [Section 5.2](/chapter-5-conscious-mind-free-will/#_5-2-extraordinary-abilities-of-the-mind)). One type, such as remote viewing, is apparently independent of distance. Targ and Katra state in *Miracles of Mind* that the accuracy and resolution in remote viewing have been shown to be insensitive to distance up to ten thousand miles. With the same assumption of objective space, a second type of non-locality is weaker the greater the distance between the two points. Because of this distance dependence, we cannot say that such phenomena are non-local in the strict sense. However, we shall continue to lump all such phenomena into the same category of non-locality. One such example is the peace and tranquillity that are commonly experienced in the presence of a great sage or in a group of meditators (discussed in [Section 5.2](/chapter-5-conscious-mind-free-will/#_5-2-extraordinary-abilities-of-the-mind) and further in [Chapter 16](/chapter-16-love-seeking-itself/)) but which decrease rapidly with increasing separation. This type might be explained, at least in part, by the concept of the so-called subtle body, which is thought to be a non-physical body that is associated with the physical body, but which can be spatially much larger.^[see, e.g., Marc Rich, *Energetic Anatomy* (2004). Barbara Brennan, *Hands of Light*, (1988) has a school in Florida where she teaches people to use auras for healing] Some people with psychic abilities are able to ‘see’ the subtle body as an aura and can observe it expand and contract with the expansion and contraction of its awareness. (Possibly some of the readers of this course have this ability.) The second type of non-locality in space might be caused by the overlap of the subtle bodies, which decreases with separation because of their finite sizes. The laws that govern the subtle body, which are not known, may allow it to be non-local in both time and space. Since we know next to nothing about it, we cannot say whether its non-locality is limited or whether it can be sensitive to all phenomena that have ever existed and all that will ever exist.

Explaining non-locality is a problem only if space is thought to be objective. If it is purely subjective, there is no problem (see [Section 6.10](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean/#_6-10-the-interpretation-of-christopher-fuchs-a-minimally-objective-mostly-subjective-interpretation)).

## 12.3. The concept of causality

In chapter 4 of *I Am That* (1973), Nisargadatta Maharaj says:

>Like everything mental, the so-called law of causation contradicts itself. No thing in existence has a particular cause; the entire universe contributes to the existence of even the smallest thing; nothing could be as it is without the universe being what it is. When the source and ground of everything is the only cause of everything, to speak of causality as a universal law is wrong. The universe is not bound by its content, because its potentialities are infinite; besides it is a manifestation, or expression of a principle fundamentally and totally free.

And in chapter 20, he says,

>Seeking out causes is a pastime of the mind. There is no duality of cause and effect. Everything is its own cause.

Seemingly, the most well established law in phenomenality is the law of causality, which states that the present and future are determined by the past. In fact, in everyday life, we usually use a more restricted form of this law, which states that a certain isolated set of events (such as your decision to take this course) at one time determines another isolated set of events at a future time (your active participation in this course). However, it is impossible to isolate any one event from all of the events that ever preceded it (e.g., it is impossible to isolate your decision from all of the preceding events of your life, and from all of the events in the lives of all of the people who have influenced you). Thus, isolated causality is a fiction because it requires the illusion of isolation of an event in space–time.

:::tip Exercise 
Examine ‘your’ decision to take this course. Can you separate it from the preceding events in your life? How did they lead up to it? Trace the time line back as far as you can.

:::tip Exercises
Remember a time when ‘you’ intended to do something, but didn’t. Remember a time when ‘you’ intended to not do something, but did.

This discussion has profound consequences with regard to our concept of free will. The concept of free will is identical to the concept of ‘I’, the freely willing, individual self that can freely bring about the satisfaction of its desires. This depends on the concept that there is an individual who is separate and isolated from the rest of the universe (see [Section 5.11](/chapter-5-conscious-mind-free-will/#_5-11-free-will-as-the-possibility-of-alternative-action), [Section 5.12](/chapter-5-conscious-mind-free-will/#_5-12-the-origin-of-the-belief-in-free-will)), who can freely choose his own desires (whose desires are unaffected by causality), and yet who can control to his satisfaction the causal chain of events in order to satisfy his desires. But, either causality is valid, in which case there can be no separate, isolated individual with freely chosen desires, or it is invalid, in which case there is no possibility that such an individual could ever cause anything to happen. However, even though an individual might be convinced in retrospect that he had no control over past events, he usually stubbornly clings to the belief that he has some control over future events. Such is the nature of identification in the face of lack of knowledge of the future.

:::tip Exercise
Close your eyes and let your attention rest on the breath. Did any thoughts or feelings come? Did they appear out of nowhere?
:::

:::tip Question
Are you afraid to give up the sense of free will? What would be the price? What would be the gain?
:::

We know that, within the concept of time, strict causality is impossible because of the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. However, if events are probabilistic rather than deterministic, then desires and actions also would be probabilistic, with no possibility of control over them by a purported doër. Thus, regardless of the degree of admixture of probability that exists in the concept of causality, it does not affect our discussion of free will and the individual.
