# Chapter 11. The Functioning of the Mind

[[toc]]

## 11.1 The nature of duality

In the meditation for May 21 in *A Net of Jewels* (1996), Ramesh says:

>It must be constantly borne in mind while trying to understand the mechanics of the apparent process of manifestation that nothing has actually been created. All that appears is mind-stuff, that of which all dreams are made, and apart from Consciousness itself, nothing exists, neither the mind nor the senses nor their objects.

In the meditation for May 20, he says:

>In one’s natural, immediate attention or awareness there are no boundaries, no separate items of manifestation, unless and until thought intrudes and directs specific concentration on a particular thing. And this is what creates separation along with the whole chain of other thoughts and reactions that lead to every kind of conflict and unhappiness, which we then interpret as bondage. But the realisation that boundaries are a product of thought is at once the realisation that the separation caused by these boundaries and the conflicts that ensue are all an illusion.

In the meditation for October 29, he says:

>The entire manifestation is purely conceptual. Nothing has actually ever been created, and nothing has ever been destroyed.

On p. 42 of *The Elements of Buddhism* (1990), John Snelling says:

<div class=indented>
A primary cause of suffering is delusion: our inability, because of subtly willful blindness, to see things the way they truly are but instead in a distorted way. The world is in fact a seamless and dynamic unity, a single living organism that is constantly undergoing change. Our minds, however, chop it up into separate, static bits and pieces, which we then try mentally and physically to manipulate. One of the mind’s most dear creations is the idea of the person and, closest to home, of a very special person which each one of us calls ‘I’: a separate, enduring ego or self. There is ‘I’ — and there is all the rest. That means conflict — and pain, for ‘I’ cannot control that fathomless vastness against which it is set. It will try, of course, as a flea might pit itself against an elephant, but it is a vain enterprise.
</div>

In this chapter, we shall depart from the trend of Chapters 9 and 10 by focusing our attention on the world instead of on what we really are. However, it will be helpful for the reader to keep in mind the lesson of those chapters, viz., that there is nothing but Consciousness. Everything else is a concept. But, in order to continue our course, we must attempt to conceptualise that which cannot be conceptualised.

In [Section 8.2](/chapter-8-transcendental-realms#_8-2-the-meaning-of-the-transcendental-realms), we saw that the conventional concept of objective reality rests on shaky grounds. In [Section 9.2](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising#_9-2-what-is-the-perceived), we saw that all separation between objects is purely conceptual because there is no separation within the wholeness of Consciousness. Likewise, we saw in [Section 9.3](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising#_9-3-what-is-the-perceiver) that the separation between pure Subjectivity (Awareness) and pure objectivity is also purely conceptual. These are examples of the way we shall use concepts to point to what is beyond concepts.

Since concepts are formed by splitting off one part of the whole from the rest, they invariably come in the form of polar pairs, that is, of pairs of inseparable opposites (e.g., ‘I’ and not-‘I’). A pair forms an indivisible whole. Thus, the two opposites must always appear together, and are conceived from what is inconceivable. Since wholeness appears to have been broken, non-duality appears to have been replaced by duality. However, this is only an appearance, a result of conceptualisation, since Consciousness is always intrinsically whole.

The appearance of duality implies a boundary line between one part and its opposite. As we shall soon see, one of the inevitable consequences of any boundary line is its potential to become a battle line, with all of the suffering that it entails.

All polar pairs, or dualities, are only conceptualisations in mind, and come and go in mind without affecting Consciousness, just as a reflection can come and go without affecting its source. All conceptual phenomena are merely reflections of Consciousness in Consciousness (the metaphor of [Section 13.9](/chapter-13-some-useful-metaphors#_13-9-the-dust-in-a-light-beam)). They are the restless waves that appear on the silent sea (the metaphor of [Section 13.4](/chapter-13-some-useful-metaphors#_13-4-the-shadow).

The yin/yang symbol of ancient Chinese philosophy^[see, e.g., [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang)] shown below (except for the captions) is a striking representation of duality within non-duality. It graphically shows how non-duality (the outer circle) appears to be broken into the two polar opposites, yin (dark) and yang (light). Each part contains the seed (a small dot) of the other part, representing the ease with which yin/yang can change into yang/yin. The boundary line between the two represents potential conflict, while non-duality itself is never disturbed by any appearances within it. In Chinese philosophy, yin signifies the female (moon) principle, and yang signifies the male (sun) principle, but, more generally, they represent any pair of polar opposites.

## 11.2. The appearance of sentience within Consciousness

We have seen two objective explanations of how the world appears out of the transcendental: 1) wave-function collapse, given in [Section 7.3](/chapter-7-summary-critique-amit-goswami-interpretation-quantum-theory-within-monistic-idealism#_7-3-the-world-in-idealism); and 2) manifestation from the transcendental realms of Nisargadatta and Ramesh, given in [Section 8.1](/chapter-8-transcendental-realms#_8-1-similarities-between-the-different-transcendental-realms). Both concepts have the logical difficulties that are discussed in [Section 8.2](/chapter-8-transcendental-realms#_8-2-the-meaning-of-the-transcendental-realms). A simpler, more general, and more verifiable concept is that the manifestation simply appears when sentience appears within Consciousness.

Sentience is the mechanism by which Consciousness becomes aware of Itself. (Objectively, sentience requires a brain connected to sensory organs; see [Section 7.6](/chapter-7-summary-critique-amit-goswami-interpretation-quantum-theory-within-monistic-idealism#_7-6-the-first-identification-the-appearance-of-sentience).) There can be no manifestation without sentience, and there can be no sentience without manifestation.

In [Chapter 9](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising/), we used the term individual mind, although we found that Awareness of all minds is universal, not individual. In simplest conceptual terms, all experience can be divided into thoughts, feelings (which are more subtle than emotions), emotions, sensations and perceptions. All of these are nothing but concepts dividing Consciousness, so none is more real than another. However, we tend to equate intensity and persistence with reality, so the last items in the list can seem to be more real than the first items. For example, emotions, sensations and perceptions can seem to be more real than feelings and thoughts because they can be more intense and persistent. However, sensations and perceptions are not inherently more real than feelings and thoughts are. On the contrary, the more attention-grabbing an object is, the more unreal it is likely to be, and the more subtle it is, the more real it is likely to be. For example, subtle feelings and thoughts (see [Section 10.1](/chapter-10-teaching-non-duality#_10-1-the-metaphysics-of-non-duality), [Chapter 16](/chapter-16-love-seeking-itself/)) are more likely to point to Reality than intense ones are, and very subtle perception (called apperception) is more likely to reveal the underlying Reality of the object (see [Section 23.3](/chapter-23-disidentification-through-inquiry#_23-3-inquiry-into-the-self-self-inquiry and [Chapter 24](/chapter-24-disidentification-through-meditation/)) than superficial perception is.

On p. 95 of *I Am That* (1984), Nisargadatta Maharaj says:

>What is beautiful? Whatever is perceived blissfully is beautiful. Bliss is the essence of beauty.

On p. 48–49 of his book *Eternity Now* (1996, see Appendix), the sage, Francis Lucille, says that Truth, Love and Beauty transcend all concepts, and come directly from the Unmanifest and are pointers to the Unmanifest. On p. 70, he says that positive feelings like love, happiness, gratitude, awe, respect and sense of beauty come from beyond the mind, and they generate release, relief and relaxation at the somatic level. These are to be contrasted with negative emotions, like anger, hatred and fear, which come from the mind, and which generate stress, heaviness, pressure, constriction and tension at the somatic level.

## 11.3. Manifestation: The first level of identification


We shall talk about three levels of identification. The appearance of sentience and the manifestation is the *first level of identification* (see [Section 7.6](/chapter-7-summary-critique-amit-goswami-interpretation-quantum-theory-within-monistic-idealism#_7-6-the-first-identification-the-appearance-of-sentience)).

In the meditation for January 12 in *A Net of Jewels* (1996), Ramesh says:

>The entire phenomenal manifestation is based on the principle of duality, which starts with the sense ‘I AM’.

In the meditation for June 9, he says:

>An infant, not being aware of having an individual identity, has no intellect with which to conceptualise and therefore lives in spontaneous freedom without resistance from moment to moment. The same is true of the self-realised sage, who has gone beyond the mind.

And in the meditation for April 10, he says:

>The life of a sage appears to others to be as purposeless as the actions of an infant. The infant lives in the bliss of ignorance, while the self-realised sage lives in the bliss beyond both ignorance and knowledge. In fact the sage is no longer even an individual, in spite of the presence of a fully developed intellect.

At the first level of identification, which is the level of the infant, Consciousness is identified with the whole because the concept of separation has not yet arisen. Until intellect arises, there can be no concepts, so there can be no distinction made between subjectivity and objectivity. (This might also be the case with insects and the lower animals.) With the appearance of intellect in man and possibly the higher animals, the concepts of separation and duality appear. These concepts appear within non-duality, e.g., the concept of the individual mind (see [Section 9.2](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising#_9-2-what-is-the-perceived)) appears within Consciousness. The working mind now appears (see [Section 11.9](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-9-the-thinking-mind-and-the-working-mind)) but still with no sense of personal doership. This is the state of the sage. The difference between the sage and the infant is that the sage has a well-developed intellect whereas the infant does not.

:::tip Question
Does the manifestation (the first level of identification) occur only in the infant? Does it also exist in the adult on waking from deep sleep? If observations occur many times per second (see [Section 6.3](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean#_6-3-the-copenhagen-interpretation-a-partly-objective-and-partly-subjective-interpretation), [Section 6.4](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean#_6-4-what-can-make-an-observation-in-the-copenhagen-interpretation), [Section 7.2](/chapter-7-summary-critique-amit-goswami-interpretation-quantum-theory-within-monistic-idealism#_7-2-schrodinger%E2%80%99s-cat-revisited)), might it also occur at each observation?
:::

In the sage, as distinct from ordinary people, there is no identification with the concepts of doership. However, in the sage as well as with ordinary people, there is identification with name and form. This means that there is direct awareness of the body’s thoughts, feelings, emotions, sensations and perceptions, but there is no direct awareness of those of any other body (see [Section 9.2](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising#_9-2-what-is-the-perceived)). Thus, when the sage says “I”, he often refers to ‘his’ body–mind but never to another body–mind. (At other times, when the sage says “I”, he often refers to Consciousness.) Ramesh says that identification with name and form is exhibited when the sage is addressed and the body responds. In the *Advaita Fellowship News* of August 2003,^[[Advaita Fellowship](https://www.advaita.org)] he says:

>The really important thing to realise — there is no need to try to remember it — is that the fact that there is no individual doer does not mean that there is no doing, that there is inaction, but that the operation of doing happens in the form not of inaction but non-action. The ego — as identification with a name and form — will remain as long as the body remains, but after Self-realisation, continues to function merely as a witness of the non-doing instead of as a doer.^[In this passage, Ramesh uses the term ‘ego’ to mean both identification with name and form after Self-realisation, and identification with doership, name and form before Self-realisation. In this course, we shall use it only in the latter sense.]

Because the sage functions from pure Awareness, when the sage speaks, it comes directly from Source without being corrupted by a ‘me’. However, what the sage says and the way it is said also depends on the conditioning of the body–mind organism, and this persists after the disappearance of the ‘me’. That is why different sages will explain their experiences of non-duality in different terms.

## 11.4 Objectification: The second level of identification

In the meditation for July 31 in *A Net of Jewels* (1996), Ramesh says:

>Bondage is nothing more than the illusion that you are an autonomous entity.

The concept of the separate ‘I’ appears in the child after the appearance of the intellect, and after there is sufficient conditioning in the body–mind organism (see [Section 5.8](/chapter-5-conscious-mind-free-will#_5-8-when-and-how-does-a-child-begin-to-perceive-objects)). Awareness then identifies with this ‘I’ concept (*the second level of identification*) to produce the sense of *personal doership and choice*, and the fictitious ‘me’, ego, or individual (see, e.g., [Section 7.6](/chapter-7-summary-critique-amit-goswami-interpretation-quantum-theory-within-monistic-idealism#_7-6-the-first-identification-the-appearance-of-sentience), [Section 7.7](/chapter-7-summary-critique-amit-goswami-interpretation-quantum-theory-within-monistic-idealism#_7-7-the-second-identification-the-appearance-of-the-%E2%80%98i%E2%80%99), [Section 7.8](/chapter-7-summary-critique-amit-goswami-interpretation-quantum-theory-within-monistic-idealism#_7-8-further-discussion-of-the-unconditioned-self-the-ego-and-freedom)). Now there is *objectification* (which we may also call *entityfication*) as well as conceptualisation; or *dualism* (which includes the sense of separation) as well as duality (which is purely conceptual, see [Section 9.5](/chapter-9-perceiving-conceptualising#_9-5-objectification-the-body%E2%80%93mind-organism-and-the-primacy-of-the-concept-of-memory)).

Whenever there is the sense of personal doership, there is also suffering because, in addition to the mind functioning as the working mind, it also functions as the thinking mind (see [Section 11.9](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/#_11-9-the-thinking-mind-and-the-working-mind)). The sage does not suffer even though there may be pain because there is no sense of personal doership that results in resistance and clinging, and no thinking mind (see [Chapter 22](/chapter-22-disidentification-from-attachment-aversion/)).

When an object is said to exist, what do we mean? It means that Awareness has identified with the ‘I’-concept, resulting in the belief that the ‘I’ is separate from the rest of the manifestation. Thus, the ‘me’ is said to *exist*. From this, we can see that *existence is conceptualisation plus identification*. After Awareness identifies with the ‘I’-concept, the pernicious beliefs in the existence of other objects also arise. Objects seem real because they seem to exist independently of each other and of our awareness of them. However, independent existence is nothing but a product of conceptualisation, identification and belief. In Reality there exists no ‘me’ or any other kind of object. There is only Consciousness.

:::tip Exercise
Do the following exercise with your eyes closed while looking past your thoughts directly at the sensations themselves. What is your immediate non-conceptual experience of the following:
 1. There are sounds, but is there something making the sounds? 
 2. There are sensations of touch and pressure, but is there something causing the sensations?
:::

Note: Sometimes we might carelessly say that Consciousness exists, but as we have already seen, Consciousness includes all existence and non-existence, and transcends both existence and non-existence (see [Section 10.1](/chapter-10-teaching-non-duality#_10-1-the-metaphysics-of-non-duality)). Another type of confusion results when the word existence is used to refer to the pure sense of Presence that always accompanies pure Awareness whenever manifestation is present. This might be called pure Existence, but we shall avoid using this terminology.

Everyone can say the following: “I am not an individual, and I am not limited”. As pure Awareness, I am unlimited Reality. Reality is the same whether the eyes are open or closed. When the eyes are closed and all thoughts and images are absent, I am the only Reality. When the eyes are open, and objects seem to be present, I am still the only Reality. Reality underlies and pervades all the objects that I perceive. That is why I am everything and everything is Me.

On p. 43 of *The Elements of Buddhism* (1990), John Snelling says:

<div class=indented>
Central to the Buddha’s teaching is the doctrine of *anatman*: ‘not-self’. This does not deny that the notion of an ‘I’ works in the everyday world. In fact, we need a solid, stable ego to function in society. However, ‘I’ is not real in an ultimate sense. It is a ‘name’: a fictional construct that bears no correspondence to what is really the case. Because of this disjunction all kinds of problems ensue. Once our minds have constructed the notion of ‘I’, it becomes our central reference point. We attach to it and identify with it totally. We attempt to advance what appears to be its interests, to defend it against real or apparent threats and menaces. And we look for ego-affirmation at every turn: confirmation that we exist and are valued. The Gordian Knot of preoccupations arising from all this absorbs us exclusively, at times to the point of obsession. This is, however, a narrow and constricted way of being. Though we cannot see it when caught in the convolutions of ego, there is something in us that is larger and deeper: a wholly other way of being.
</div>

On p.64 of *Nuggets of Wisdom* (2005) by Ramesh Balsekar, he says:

>The total acceptance of non-doership means the end of the load of guilt and shame for one’s own actions and the load of hatred and malice towards the other for his actions. The removal of the load means the automatic presence of peace and harmony — equanimity.

On p.65, he says:

>There is a distinct difference between the anger, grief or fear of the sage and that of an ordinary person. The sage’s emotion is not based on any selfish motivation; and the sage’s emotion is always in the present moment, and therefore very short-lived. No residual impression remains in the mind that could lead to involvement in horizontal time.

The beliefs in the existence of the ‘me’ and of the world are more persistent than they would be if they were known to be purely conceptual. Since the mind consists not only of thoughts, but also of feelings, emotions, sensations and perceptions, identification and belief can percolate down to these other levels, too. In particular, the emotions of guilt, shame, hatred, malice, envy, jealousy, pride and arrogance are compelling evidence for a continuing identification with, and belief in, the ‘me’. Upon awakening, these emotions disappear. Other emotions may arise, but there is no identification with them, so they quickly disappear without causing suffering. In particular, when a sage exhibits anger, it passes quickly without lingering because there is no identification with it.

How does the sense of personal doership lead to suffering?

:::tip Question
How do the following emotions depend on the sense of personal doership? Guilt, shame, hatred, envy, jealousy, pride.
:::

Belief in separation is extremely persistent, and is virtually invulnerable to superficial mental practices, such as the mechanical repetition of aphorisms, affirmations or denials. For example, the thought that ‘I’ exist as an individual is not nearly as difficult to see through as the feeling that ‘I’ exist. Therefore, in order for a practice to be effective, it must be seen and felt directly that there is no ‘me’ and there is no separation. Such practices are the subjects of [Chapter 20](/chapter-20-understanding-direct-seeing/), [Chapter 22](/chapter-22-disidentification-from-attachment-aversion/), [Chapter 23](/chapter-23-disidentification-through-inquiry/), [Chapter 24](/chapter-24-disidentification-through-meditation/).

It is the appearance of the conceptual, dualistic individual that is the source of all conflict, suffering and striving in the world. However, the individual is an illusion because the apparently individual awareness is actually still pure Awareness. There is always only one Awareness, never multiple awarenesses. The individual is only a conceptual object because its subjectivity is really pure Subjectivity.

When the ‘me’ seems to appear, a boundary seems to arise between itself and everything else. This is represented in [Figure 1 of Chapter 10](/chapter-10-teaching-non-duality#figure1) by the boxes in the upper right labelled ‘me’ and not-‘me’. The boundary line between the ‘me’ and the not-‘me’ becomes a potential battle line, with the ‘me’ warring with the not-‘me’. The only way this battle line can be eliminated is for the ‘me’ to vanish completely, i.e., for the recognition to occur that there never has been a ‘me’. This is the perception of the sage.

## 11.5. Ownership: The third level of identification

We have seen that the first level of identification is the manifestation itself, when Consciousness becomes aware of Itself, while the second level is identification of Awareness with the concept of the separate ‘I’ and its doership, resulting in the fictitious ‘me’. The primary self-image of this illusory entity is that of observer, doer, thinker, decider and experiencer. But conditioning and identification produce not only this false self, but also various kinds of thoughts, opinions and images about the false self. Some examples of these are its competence, incompetence, beauty, ugliness, goodness and evilness.

With the appearance of these concepts arises also the possibility that Awareness will identify with them. This results in a **third level of identification, the level of ownership, or ‘mine’,** consisting of many forms of embellishment on the basic ‘me’. Without this third level of identification, the ‘me’ is bare, consisting only in the sense of doership (which includes observership, thinkership and decidership). With it, the ‘me’ becomes clothed not only in thoughts and images, but also in feelings and emotions. Feelings and emotions do not cause suffering unless there is ownership of them. Then many different kinds of suffering occur. The third level of identification is the one that causes all the trouble (some might say all the fun) but it depends entirely on the assumed existence of the doer. This fully identified (clothed) ‘me’ seems to suffer unlimited agonies over whether it is good enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, competent enough, healthy enough, strong enough, loving enough, caring enough and many other ‘enoughs’. It feels guilty about ‘its’ actions in the past, and worries about how ‘it’ will perform in the future. It sometimes sees itself as a bag of shit, and at other times, as a god or goddess. However, sooner or later it will see itself as a victim, i.e., as an entity that suffers at the hands of something else (see [Section 11.7](/chapter-11-functioning-mind#_11-7-the-victim-victimiser-polar-pair)).

## 11.6. Polar pairs, separation and suffering

It is apparent from the preceding paragraph that we are beginning to be immersed in dualistic language when we speak of the doing and functioning of the ‘me’ or ego. For the purpose of efficient communication in the remainder of this chapter, we shall often use this dualistic mode of speaking. However, it should always remain clear that the ego, being nothing but a concept, is powerless to do anything. Everything that happens is still entirely the impersonal functioning of Consciousness. Nobody ever does anything because there is nobody to do it.

In chapter 34 of *I Am That* (1984), Nisargadatta Maharaj says:

>What is birth and death but the beginning and the ending of a stream of events in consciousness? Because of the idea of separation and limitation they are painful. Momentary relief from pain we call pleasure — and we build castles in the air hoping for endless pleasure which we call happiness. It is all misunderstanding and misuse. Wakeup, go beyond, live really.

And in chapter 82, he says,

Our life is full of contradictions. Yet we cling to it. This clinging is at the root of everything. Still, it is entirely superficial. We hold on to something or somebody with all our might and next moment we forget it; like a child that shapes its mud-pies and abandons them light-heartedly. Touch them — it will scream with anger, divert the child and he forgets them. For our life is now, and the love of it is now. We love variety, the play of pain and pleasure, we are fascinated by contrasts. For this we need the opposites and their apparent separation. We enjoy them for a time and then get tired and crave for the peace and silence of pure being.

In the meditation for July 28 in *A Net of Jewels* (1996), Ramesh says:

>The intellect divides everything between what it considers pleasant (acceptable) and unpleasant (unacceptable) and then opposes anything it deems unacceptable as a ‘problem’ that needs solving! Thus any problem can only be solved at its source, which is the intellect that conceived the problem as a problem in the first place.

In each present moment, we can see that we are doing nothing (see [Section 10.2](/chapter-10-teaching-non-duality#_10-2-the-practices), [Section 23.2](/chapter-23-disidentification-through-inquiry#_23-2-inquiry-into-the-self-self-inquiry)), thus there can be no doer in the present moment. The ego is the identification with the thought that ‘I’ have done something in the past, or ‘I’ can do something in the future. Thus, it is inseparable from the concepts of past and future (see [Section 12.1](/chapter-12-space-time-causality-destiny#_12-1-the-concepts-of-space-and-time)). That is why its desires and fears are always tied to the past or future.

Identification as the ego gives me the perception that ‘I’ am separate from my body–mind, which makes the body–mind a threat to my survival, and separate from you, which sometimes makes you appear to be a threat to my survival. The threats seem real only because hidden in the ego is the knowledge that it itself is only a concept, and is therefore vulnerable to myriad forces outside itself. Intrinsic to ego identification is the fear of ego death even though death is a concept that is not understood by the ego (the mind cannot conceive of its own absence). Since fear of death is intrinsic to the ego, the body, which is the sentient object that is the basis of the ego, appears to be the ego’s enemy because it is vulnerable to many outside forces as well as to its imagined defects. The ego knows that the body must die so it lives in constant fear of this happening. At the same time, the ego glorifies the death of the body when it can imagine that somehow death will glorify itself. To some egos, nothing is more glorious than to die in battle.

Since the ego is nothing but a concept, other concepts can appear to be threats to it, including concepts about the ego itself. Some of these concepts conflict with the ego’s self-esteem, such as the concepts of being wrong, ignorant, weak, defective, unattractive or guilty. When it sees itself as being deficient, such as when it compares itself with other egos or when another ego insults it or offends it, it attacks itself through self-hatred and self-punishment. When it sees others as guilty, enemies or victimisers, it attacks them. The ego always sees itself as victim, never as victimiser, and thus is able to justify virtually any action in defence of itself. The ego finds it very easy to ally itself with other concepts because it finds strength in concepts. This is particularly true of ideological concepts, many of which are adopted by numerous other egos, thus allowing the ego to see numbers as strength.

:::tip Question
What are some examples of the ego thinking of itself as victim, and attacking?
:::

The concept of ‘I’ necessarily requires the concept of its polar opposite, the not-‘I’, or other, i.e., everything but the ‘I’. Since ‘I’ and not-‘I’ are a polar pair, the ‘I’ sees everything as being divided into polar pairs. The concept of right necessarily requires the concept of wrong, good requires evil, God requires Satan, guilt requires innocence, light requires darkness, health requires illness, rich requires poor, knowledge requires ignorance, etc. All of these are merely concepts that are formed by drawing conceptual boundaries between the opposites in an inseparable pair of concepts. These boundaries are purely arbitrary, and can be moved as the occasion demands. For example, what appears to be right at one time and place will appear to be wrong at another, or what appears to be wealth in one place will appear to be poverty in another.

:::tip Question
What are some examples of good here being evil elsewhere, and vice versa?
:::

Note: Many passages in the Bible can be interpreted as metaphors for non-dual teachings. For example, Genesis 2:17 graphically describes the fatal consequences of dividing Consciousness into polar pairs:

>…but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.
