## 7.1. The physics of monistic idealism

Until now, except for the subjective interpretation of quantum theory, the physics that has been discussed is based on the concept of an external, objective reality verified by experimental observations and, as long as the alternative interpretations of quantum theory that were presented are included, it would probably receive consensus agreement among most physicists. However, the present chapter is much more speculative. In it we present some of the results from Amit Goswami’s 1993 book, *The Self-Aware Universe*. We shall see that Goswami assumes the validity of the concept of an objective reality, but is forced into a questionable extension of this concept into a realm that is unmeasurable and unverifiable, the transcendental realm. We cite Goswami’s theory as a good example of the quandary that results when an *objective theory* is postulated to explain *subjective experience*.

Goswami attempts to place his quantum theory of consciousness within the overall context of monistic idealism (see [Section 1.4](/chapter-1-three-major-metaphysical-philosophies#_1-4-idealism-pure-subjectivity-the-philosophy-that-consciousness-is-all-and-all-is-consciousness)). In so doing, he postulates that consciousness has the following structure:

<div style="margin-left: 3rem">
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Consciousness, the ground of all being, is primary.</li>
<li>Consciousness contains the following three realms: the two immanent realms, which are the world of matter and the world of mental phenomena; and the transcendental realm. All of these realms exist within and as consciousness, so there is nothing outside of consciousness.</li>
<li>The transcendental realm is the source of the immanent realms. In his theory, the immanent realms are the phenomenal manifestation of the transcendental realm.</li>
</ol>
</div>

Traditional idealism holds that consciousness is the primary reality, and that all objects, whether material or mental, are objects within consciousness. However, it does not explain how the individual subject or experiencer in the subject–object experience arises. Even traditional monistic idealism, however, states that the consciousness of the individual subject is *identical* to the consciousness that is the ground of all being. The sense of separation that we feel is an illusion, as has always been claimed by the sages.

The sages proclaim that separation does not exist in reality. Ignorance of our true nature gives us the illusion of separateness, and this sense of separateness is the basis of all of our suffering (see [Chapter 11](/chapter-11-functioning-mind/)). Monistic idealism tells us that the sense of separation is illusory, but Goswami’s interpretation of quantum theory within monistic idealism goes further by purporting to explain how the illusion arises.

As we saw in [Section 6.9](/chapter-6-what-does-quantum-theory-mean#_6-9-the-astonishing-implications-of-the-non-locality-of-consciousness), if wave-function collapse is the mechanism for manifestation, it must be simultaneous everywhere. Yet, in an objective theory, how can it manifest everywhere simultaneously without violating Einsteinian locality? Goswami replies that, in monistic idealism, wave-function collapse does not occur in space–time because wave-function collapse is what manifests space–time. He argues that the wave-function exists not in space–time, but in a transcendental domain. Therefore, wave-function collapse does not violate Einsteinian locality.

The transcendental realm must not be thought of as including, or as being included in, the physical world of space–time. Transcendental in this context means absence of space–time. The transcendental realm cannot be located or perceived. It can be pointed to but only by pointing away from all that is perceived — not this, not that, not anything known, not anything knowable.

Recall that, in our adaptation of Plato’s cave allegory (see [Section 1.4](/chapter-1-three-major-metaphysical-philosophies#_1-4-idealism-pure-subjectivity-the-philosophy-that-consciousness-is-all-and-all-is-consciousness)), the material world consists of the shadows of Plato’s transcendental archetypes. In Goswami’s picture, the wave-functions are the equivalent of the transcendental archetypes. Consciousness manifests the immanent from the transcendent by collapsing the wave-function. All of this occurs entirely within consciousness.
