# Chapter 11. The Functioning of the Mind

[[toc]]

## 11.1 The nature of duality

In the meditation for May 21 in *A Net of Jewels* (1996), Ramesh says:

>It must be constantly borne in mind while trying to understand the mechanics of the apparent process of manifestation that nothing has actually been created. All that appears is mind-stuff, that of which all dreams are made, and apart from Consciousness itself, nothing exists, neither the mind nor the senses nor their objects.

In the meditation for May 20, he says:

>In one’s natural, immediate attention or awareness there are no boundaries, no separate items of manifestation, unless and until thought intrudes and directs specific concentration on a particular thing. And this is what creates separation along with the whole chain of other thoughts and reactions that lead to every kind of conflict and unhappiness, which we then interpret as bondage. But the realisation that boundaries are a product of thought is at once the realisation that the separation caused by these boundaries and the conflicts that ensue are all an illusion.

In the meditation for October 29, he says:

>The entire manifestation is purely conceptual. Nothing has actually ever been created, and nothing has ever been destroyed.

On p. 42 of *The Elements of Buddhism* (1990), John Snelling says:

<div class=indented>
A primary cause of suffering is delusion: our inability, because of subtly willful blindness, to see things the way they truly are but instead in a distorted way. The world is in fact a seamless and dynamic unity, a single living organism that is constantly undergoing change. Our minds, however, chop it up into separate, static bits and pieces, which we then try mentally and physically to manipulate. One of the mind’s most dear creations is the idea of the person and, closest to home, of a very special person which each one of us calls ‘I’: a separate, enduring ego or self. There is ‘I’ — and there is all the rest. That means conflict — and pain, for ‘I’ cannot control that fathomless vastness against which it is set. It will try, of course, as a flea might pit itself against an elephant, but it is a vain enterprise.

In this chapter, we shall depart from the trend of Chapters 9 and 10 by focusing our attention on the world instead of on what we really are. However, it will be helpful for the reader to keep in mind the lesson of those chapters, viz., that there is nothing but Consciousness. Everything else is a concept. But, in order to continue our course, we must attempt to conceptualise that which cannot be conceptualised.
